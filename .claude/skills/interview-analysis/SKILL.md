# Interview Analysis
*Synthesize User Research Insights from Interview Sessions*

## What This Skill Does

Analyzes user interview transcripts and notes to:
- Map findings back to original research goals (from interview guide)
- Identify patterns and themes across multiple sessions
- Extract verbatim quotes as evidence
- Score confidence levels based on frequency
- Generate actionable recommendations

**Perfect for:**
- Discovery Research analysis
- Validation Research synthesis
- Usability Testing insights
- Post-interview pattern detection

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Setup & Context

1. **Load Interview Guide**
   - Ask user: "Which project? What's the interview guide location?"
   - Default: `/outputs/interview-guides/[project-name].md`
   - Extract: Research Goals, Key Questions, Success Criteria

2. **Scan Interview Files**
   - Location: `/user_context/raw/interviews/[project-name]/`
   - Supported formats: .txt, .md, .pdf
   - List files found, ask for confirmation

3. **Clarify Context (optional)**
   ```
   "Quick context questions:
   - How many participants? (for frequency analysis)
   - Any segments to track? (e.g., B2B vs. B2C, roles)
   - Which prototype/version tested? (if applicable)"
   ```

### Phase 2: Analysis (per interview file)

For each interview file:

1. **Read & Classify**
   - Identify: Participant info, date, format
   - Quick scan: Topics covered, length

2. **Extract Core Elements**
   - **Goal Mapping:** Which research goals addressed?
   - **Key Insights:** Main takeaways (3-5 per interview)
   - **Pain Points:** Problems mentioned
   - **Jobs to be Done:** What user wants to achieve
   - **Verbatim Quotes:** Best quotes (evidence!)
   - **Unexpected Findings:** Surprises not in guide
   - **UI/Prototype Feedback:** If tested (optional)

3. **Tag & Categorize**
   - Theme tags (e.g., "Navigation", "Pricing", "Onboarding")
   - Sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, mixed)
   - Confidence flag (strong statement vs. hesitant)

### Phase 3: Synthesis (cross-interview)

1. **Pattern Detection**
   - Identify recurring themes
   - Count frequency (how many participants mentioned?)
   - Segment differences (if applicable)

2. **Confidence Scoring**
   Per insight:
   - **High Confidence:** 5+ mentions, clear pattern, consistent sentiment
   - **Medium Confidence:** 2-4 mentions, emerging pattern
   - **Low Confidence:** 1 mention, anecdotal, needs validation

3. **Goal Achievement Check**
   For each goal from interview guide:
   - ‚úÖ **Fully Answered:** Clear findings, high confidence
   - üü° **Partially Answered:** Some data, needs more research
   - ‚ùå **Not Answered:** No coverage, follow-up needed

### Phase 4: Report Generation

Create: `/outputs/interviews/[project-name]/[project-name]-analysis.md`

**Report Structure:**

```markdown
---
project: [Name]
interview_guide: /outputs/interview-guides/[name].md
sessions_analyzed: [X]

### Phase 4.5: PRD Opportunities (Optional)

**After report generation, offer to create PRD Starter Briefs for promising features.**

This phase bridges Interview Analysis ‚Üí PRD Creation by preparing "PRD Starter Briefs" that give the `prd-creator` Skill a strong foundation.

#### Step 1: Identify Opportunities

From the analysis, identify potential features/solutions:

```
"Based on the insights, I see [X] potential feature opportunities:

1. **[Feature Name]** (High Impact/Medium Effort)
   - Solves Pain Point: [Reference from analysis]
   - Backed by: [Insight #X] (High Confidence, 7/10)
   - Quote: "[...]" - P3

2. **[Feature Name]** (Medium Impact/Low Effort)
   - Addresses: [Job to be Done]
   - Backed by: [Insight #Y] (Medium Confidence, 4/10)

3. **[Feature Name]** (High Impact/High Effort)
   - Strategic opportunity from Cross-Cutting Theme Z
   - Backed by: [Multiple insights]

Want to create PRD Starter Briefs for any of these?"
```

**Impact/Effort Matrix:**
- **High Impact/Low Effort** ‚Üí Quick Wins (P0)
- **High Impact/Medium Effort** ‚Üí Strategic (P0-P1)
- **High Impact/High Effort** ‚Üí Big Bets (P1-P2)
- **Medium Impact/Low Effort** ‚Üí Nice to Have (P1-P2)

#### Step 2: User Selection (Interactive!)

Ask user which opportunities to develop:

```
"Which features should we create PRD Starter Briefs for?
- All 3?
- Just the Quick Wins (#2)?
- Let's discuss each first?

I'll create starter briefs TOGETHER with you - you can add your thoughts,
constraints, scope ideas, etc."
```

**WICHTIG:** Interaktiver Prozess! Nicht einfach automatisch generieren.

#### Step 3: Create Starter Briefs (Collaboratively)

For each selected feature, create a PRD Starter Brief GEMEINSAM mit User:

   - Initial Scope (what's in/out)
   - Supporting Evidence (quotes, frequency)

2. **User Input Loop**
   ```
   "I've drafted a starter brief for [Feature X].

   Before I save it, feedback:
   - Problem Statement resonant?
   - Missing any constraints? (technical, business, time)
   - Scope boundaries clear?
   - Any must-have context for PRD creation?"
   ```

3. **Refine Together**
   - User adds technical constraints
   - User clarifies scope boundaries
   - User adds strategic context
   - User suggests success metrics adjustments

4. **Save Starter Brief**
   Location: `/outputs/interviews/[project]/[feature-name]-starter-brief.md`

**PRD Starter Brief Template:**

## Examples

### Example 1: Discovery Research

**Input:**
```
User: "Analyze my PM Tool interviews"
- Interview Guide: /outputs/interview-guides/pm-tool-discovery.md
- Files: 10 transcripts in /user_context/raw/interviews/pm-tool/
- Context: B2B SaaS, Scale-up PMs (50-200 employees)
```

**Process:**
1. Load guide ‚Üí Goals: Understand Jira pain points, workflow inefficiencies
2. Analyze 10 transcripts ‚Üí Extract insights per goal
3. Find patterns:
   - 8/10 mentioned "Jira comment chaos"
   - 6/10 mentioned "Confluence ‚Üí Jira manual work"
4. Score confidence: High (frequent + consistent)
5. Generate report with quotes, recommendations

**Output:**
- `/outputs/interviews/pm-tool/pm-tool-analysis.md`
- Executive Summary: "Scale-up PMs waste 2-3h daily on Jira/Confluence manual work"
- Top Insight: "Comment management is #1 pain point (High Confidence, 8/10)"
- Recommendation: "Build Jira Comment Digest tool (High Impact, Medium Effort)"

**Phase 4.5 (PRD Opportunities):**
- Identified 2 PRD opportunities: "Jira Comment Digest" (P0), "Confluence-Jira Sync" (P1)
- User selected: "Jira Comment Digest"
- Created: `/outputs/interviews/pm-tool/comment-digest-starter-brief.md`
- User added constraints: "Must integrate with existing Jira API", "Target: <5min setup"
- Ready for `prd-creator` Skill!

### Example 2: Usability Testing

**Input:**
```
User: "Extract insights from prototype tests"
- Interview Guide: /outputs/interview-guides/checkout-flow-usability.md
- Files: 5 session notes in /user_context/raw/interviews/checkout-flow/
- Context: E-commerce checkout redesign, mobile users
```

**Process:**
1. Load guide ‚Üí Test: New 3-step checkout vs. old 5-step
2. Analyze 5 sessions ‚Üí UI feedback per screen
3. Find patterns:
   - 4/5 confused by payment screen layout
   - 5/5 loved progress indicator
   - 3/5 missed "Save for later" button
4. Map to goals: "Reduce cart abandonment" ‚Üí Partially Answered

**Output:**
- Report with screen-by-screen feedback
- High Confidence: Progress indicator = win (keep!)
- Medium Confidence: Payment layout needs iteration (4/5 struggled)
- Recommendation: A/B test payment layout variants

## Tips & Best Practices

**‚úÖ DO:**
- **Verbatim Quotes are Evidence** ‚Üí Always include for top insights
- **Frequency = Confidence** ‚Üí "7/10 said X" > "Someone mentioned X"
- **Segment Analysis** ‚Üí If data exists (B2B vs. B2C, roles, etc.)
- **Map to Goals** ‚Üí Always tie findings back to original research goals
- **Actionable Recommendations** ‚Üí "Prototype X" not "Consider exploring X maybe"
- **Highlight Gaps** ‚Üí What you DIDN'T learn is as important as what you did

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Ignore minority opinions (1/10 can be valid edge case!)
- Cherry-pick quotes that confirm bias
- Over-interpret anecdotal data (1 mention ‚â† pattern)
- Skip confidence scoring (user needs to know certainty)
- Forget context (B2B PM ‚â† B2C User, different needs!)

**Note:** Starter Briefs saved in SAME folder as analysis (no subfolder!) - keeps structure minimal.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Files not found**
‚Üí Check: `/user_context/raw/interviews/[project-name]/` exists?
‚Üí Ask user to confirm project name & file location

**Issue: No interview guide**
‚Üí Can proceed without (create ad-hoc goals)
‚Üí OR use `interview-guide` Skill to create one first

**Issue: Mixed formats hard to parse**
‚Üí Ask user: "Can you provide .txt/.md versions? PDFs are trickier."
‚Üí Use Read tool for PDFs (works but less reliable)

**Issue: Conflicting insights**
‚Üí Flag in report: "3 said X, 2 said opposite ‚Üí needs clarification"
‚Üí Confidence: Medium or Low (uncertainty noted)

**Issue: Too many quotes**
‚Üí Limit to 2-3 per insight (best/most representative)
‚Üí More quotes in Appendix if needed

---

## Success Criteria

**Analysis complete when:**
- ‚úÖ All interview files processed
- ‚úÖ Goals from guide mapped to findings (or flagged as gaps)
- ‚úÖ Patterns identified with frequency counts
- ‚úÖ Confidence scored per insight
- ‚úÖ Verbatim quotes included as evidence
- ‚úÖ Actionable recommendations generated
- ‚úÖ Report saved to `/outputs/interviews/[project]/`

**User should have:**
- Clear understanding of what was learned
- Confidence in findings (backed by frequency + quotes)
- Concrete next steps (recommendations)
- Awareness of gaps (what needs more research)
