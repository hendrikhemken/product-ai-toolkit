## 🔄 Weekly Cadence (Wodtke Style)

### Monday Commitments (15 min)
**"What are we doing THIS WEEK for these OKRs?"**

- Update confidence level (0.0-1.0) for each KR
- Pick 1-3 concrete actions per KR
- Write down commitments

### Friday Celebrations (15 min)
**"What did we accomplish? What did we learn?"**

- Mark wins (even small ones!)
- Update progress on KRs
- Learning: What's working? What's not?
- Adjust next week's approach

**Without weekly cadence → OKRs die!** (Wodtke's #1 Rule)

---

## 🚨 Critical Reminders

### Wodtke's 5 Deadly Mistakes (AVOID!)
1. ❌ **Set & Forget** → Weekly tracking is NON-NEGOTIABLE!
2. ❌ **Goal-of-Week Whiplash** → Don't change OKRs mid-quarter!
3. ❌ **Too Many OKRs** → 1 Objective, 3-5 KRs max!
4. ❌ **Micromanaging** → Trust yourself, focus on outcomes
5. ❌ **All at Once** → Start with pilot, iterate!

### Red Team Check
**Ask yourself weekly:**
- Can I game these KRs? (If YES → add quality gates!)
- Can I achieve this without business impact? (If YES → rewrite!)
- Am I measuring activities or outcomes? (Outcomes only!)

### OKRs ≠ Performance Review
**Remember:**
- OKRs = Stretch goals (designed to sometimes fail)
- Performance = Job expectations (must hit)
- NEVER conflate them or you'll sandbag immediately!

### When okr-monday Updates (Every Monday)

**Updates 2 files:**
1. `/outputs/okrs/Q4-2025-OKRs.md` (Week X section)
2. `/outputs/okrs/CURRENT_WEEK.md` (new commitments, move to Week X+1)

### When okr-friday Updates (Every Friday)

**Updates 2 files:**
