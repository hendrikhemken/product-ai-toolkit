# OKR Best Practices - Quick Reference

*Essential do's and don'ts for effective OKRs*

---

## ✅ Golden Rules

### 1. Outcomes Over Outputs
**Always measure results, not activities**

❌ **Bad:**
- "Ship 3 features"
- "Run 10 user interviews"
- "Write 5 blog posts"

✅ **Good:**
- "Increase engagement from 20% to 35%"
- "5 validated customer insights with documented impact"
- "Generate 1000 qualified leads from content"

### 2. Measurability is Non-Negotiable
**Marissa Mayer's Rule:** "It's not a key result unless it has a number"

❌ **Bad:**
- "Improve user experience"
- "Make product better"
- "Increase customer satisfaction"

✅ **Good:**
- "Increase NPS from 30 to 50"
- "Reduce load time from 3s to 1s"
- "Achieve 4.5 stars on App Store (from 3.2)"

### 3. Ambition Level: 5/10 Confidence
**Should feel uncomfortable but achievable**

❌ **Too Safe:** 100% sure you'll hit it
❌ **Unrealistic:** 10% chance of success
✅ **Sweet Spot:** 50/50 shot - makes you nervous

**Grading:**
- 0.6-0.7 = SUCCESS ✅
- 1.0 = Too conservative (sandbag next time)
- 0.3 = Too ambitious or wrong approach

### 4. OKRs ≠ Performance Reviews
**CRITICAL SEPARATION**

❌ **Never:**
- Tie OKRs to bonuses
- Use for individual performance ratings
- Punish teams for missing stretch goals

✅ **Always:**
- Separate conversations
- Use for learning & alignment
- Celebrate 0.6-0.7 as success

## 🚫 Common Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern #1: Activity-Based Key Results

**Problem:** Measuring tasks, not outcomes

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Ship 5 features"
- ❌ "Hold 20 customer meetings"
- ❌ "Launch MVP"

**Red Team Check:** "Could we achieve this without business impact?"
- If YES → Add quality gates!

**Fix:**
- ✅ "Increase retention from 40% to 60%"
- ✅ "Close 5 enterprise deals worth $100K+"
- ✅ "50 beta users with NPS 40+"

---

### Anti-Pattern #2: Too Many OKRs

**Problem:** No real focus, everything is "priority"

**Symptoms:**
- 7+ Objectives
- 10+ Key Results per Objective
- Teams overwhelmed

**Why It Fails:**
- Human working memory = 3-5 items
- More than that = diluted focus
- "If everything is important, nothing is"

**Fix:**
- Max 3-5 Objectives
- Max 3-5 KRs per Objective
- Say NO to everything else

---

### Anti-Pattern #3: Sandbagging (Too Conservative)

**Problem:** Goals too easy, no stretch

**Symptoms:**
- 100% confident at quarter start
- Always hitting 1.0 scores
- No innovation or risk-taking

**Why It Happens:**
- Fear of failure
- OKRs tied to performance reviews
- Culture punishes misses

**Fix:**
- Target 5/10 confidence
- Celebrate 0.6-0.7 scores
- Separate OKRs from comp
- Leadership models ambition

---

### Anti-Pattern #4: Gameable Metrics

**Problem:** Can hit the number without real impact

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Launch 5 features" → Could be junk
- ❌ "10K new users" → Could be bots/churned
- ❌ "100 sales calls" → Could be low quality

**Rick Klau's Red Team Review:**
> "Could we harm the company by achieving these?"

**Fix - Add Quality Gates:**
- ✅ "Launch 5 features with NPS 40+"
- ✅ "10K new users with 40% D7 retention"
- ✅ "100 sales calls with 20% close rate"

---

### Anti-Pattern #5: No Weekly Cadence

**Problem:** Set & forget, check only at quarter end

**Wodtke's Core Insight:**
> "The secret to OKRs is not the framework, it's the cadence"

**What Happens:**
- OKRs become stale
- No course-correction
- Learning happens too late

**Fix - Weekly Rhythm:**
- **Monday:** Commitments (what will we do this week?)
- **Friday:** Celebrations (what did we accomplish?)
- **Update confidence levels weekly**
- **Discuss blockers & learnings**

---

### Anti-Pattern #6: No Prerequisites Met

**Problem:** Using OKRs when organization isn't ready

**Missing Prerequisites:**
- ❌ No clear strategy
- ❌ No team autonomy
- ❌ No control over priorities
- ❌ No leadership commitment

**What Happens:**
- Frustration & wasted effort
- OKRs ignored or gamed
- Team morale drops
- OKRs become meaningless

**Fix:**
1. Check prerequisites FIRST
2. If missing → Use alternatives:
   - Project management (Jira)
   - Kanban for service teams
   - Sprint Goals for Agile
3. Fix org issues BEFORE implementing OKRs

**Christina Wodtke:**
> "If your teams don't have autonomy, don't use OKRs. You'll frustrate everyone."

---

### Anti-Pattern #7: Cargo Cult OKRs

**Problem:** Copying Google without understanding principles

**Symptoms:**
- Buy expensive OKR software first
- Copy example OKRs verbatim
- No adaptation to company context
- "We have OKRs" but nothing changes

**Fix:**
- Start with simple tools (Sheets, Docs)
- Understand WHY before HOW
- Adapt to your company size & type
- Software AFTER process works
