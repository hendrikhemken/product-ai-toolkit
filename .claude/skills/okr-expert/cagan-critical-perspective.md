# Team Objectives – Overview

After many years of being a very vocal advocate for the OKR (Objectives and Key Results) technique, in the majority of companies I meet, I have stopped recommending the practice.

That’s because, in so many companies, even though conceptually the technique is simple and sound, it ends up proving a waste of time and effort, and yields little if any results.

How can something so conceptually simple have such a hard time being applied in practice?

The short answer is that most companies are not set up to effectively apply this technique.

As I see it, there are three fundamental reasons for this:

_Feature Teams vs. Product Teams_

If the company is still using[ feature teams](https://svpg.com/product-vs-feature-teams/), as most unfortunately are, then the OKR technique is going to be a cultural mismatch, and almost certainly prove a waste of time and effort.

The OKR technique came from companies that had empowered product teams in their DNA. OKR’s are first and foremost _an empowerment technique_.

The main idea is to give product teams real problems to solve, and then to give the teams the space to solve them.

Yet the telltale sign of mismatch out there is that companies think they can “check the empowerment box” by giving the team objectives, yet still continue to tell them the solutions they are supposed to deliver – nearly always in the form of a roadmap of features and projects with expected release dates.

_Manager’s Objectives vs. Product Team Objectives_

The second issue is that the purpose of a cross-functional, empowered product team is to work together to solve hard problems.

Yet, in so many companies, each manager – the manager of engineers, the manager of designers and the manager of product managers – creates their own _organizational_ objectives, which are then cascaded down to their employees.

While this may sound reasonable, and is not necessarily a problem for other parts of the company, in practice this means that these employees – when working with their cross-functional colleagues in a product team – are all working on _their own_ objectives, rather than working collaboratively on the _team_ objectives.

To make matters even worse, in many companies, there’s an additional level of complexity and dilution because they also try to implement _individual_ objectives, so not only does the engineer inherit the objectives from her manager, but she also has to work on her own personal objectives.

_The Role of Leadership_

And finally, and really the root of the problem, is that in the vast majority of companies I see that are struggling to get any value out of OKR’s, the role of leadership is largely missing in action.

They literally think that the idea is to let teams identify a set of objectives, and then let them pursue those objectives, and we’ll see where we are at the end of the quarter.

They think that empowered product teams, and this technique especially, is about _less_ management. But it’s actually about _better_ management.

It is really any wonder why so many companies get so little value from this technique?

It’s no secret that most of the leading tech product companies use the OKR technique, or one of the variants. And it’s also no secret how much success these companies have had.

Yet people are confusing correlation with causation.

Those successful companies aren’t successful _because_ they use OKR’s. They use OKR’s because it is designed to leverage the _empowered product team_ model. 

And as I have tried to make clear with years of articles and talks, the empowered product team model is a fundamentally different approach to building and running a tech-product organization.

You can’t take your old organization based on feature teams, roadmaps and passive managers, then overlay a technique from a radically different culture, and expect that will work or change anything.

So in terms of actually getting the _benefits_ of OKR’s, there are three critical prerequisites:

  1. Move from the feature team model to the empowered product team model
  2. Stop doing manager objectives and individual objectives, and focus on team objectives
  3. Leaders need to step up and do their part to turn product strategy into action



The majority of my writing has been about the first topic.

For the second item, this is mainly education.

It is the third item that needs much more discussion, so in the upcoming series of articles on team objectives, we’ll discuss the role of leadership in effective team objectives.

First, we’ll discuss specifically how we [_empower_](http://www.svpg.com/team-objectives-empowerment) teams through team objectives.

Then, we’ll discuss how we execute on our product strategy through [_action_](http://www.svpg.com/team-objectives-action).

Next, we’ll discuss how leaders manage a portfolio of risk by sharing with teams how [_ambitious_](http://www.svpg.com/team-objectives-ambition) they would like them to be as they pursue the problems they’ve been asked to solve.

It’s critical to note that sometimes it’s not about the level of ambition, but rather, we need to occasionally make what’s called a _[high-integrity commitment](http://www.svpg.com/team-objectives-commitments),_ and we need to discuss how these are made and managed.

One of the common misconceptions about team objectives is that only a single product team should work on a specific problem. On the contrary, much of our best work requires [_collaboration_](http://www.svpg.com/team-objectives-collaboration) between teams, and there are several important forms of collaboration we’ll discuss.

As with any difficult technology-based endeavor, we need to actively [_manage_](http://www.svpg.com/team-objectives-management) this work, always being mindful to manage by coaching and servant leadership, and not to regress to command and control style management, and lose the benefits of empowerment.

Along with empowerment comes [_accountability_](http://www.svpg.com/team-objectives-accountability) , and we need to discuss what this means in practice.

Finally, we’ll _[summarize](http://www.svpg.com/team-objectives-summary)_ with the most important points to getting the real value out of team objectives.

# Team Objectives – Empowerment

_NOTE_ : _There is so much widespread confusion out there on OKR’s, it’s a very difficult topic to discuss because everyone brings their own very different experiences and perspective to the conversation. If your company is using OKR’s today and you believe they are truly helping you deliver consistent innovation, then no need to read further. However, if you have found that for whatever reason this technique has not delivered the promised value, then I’d encourage you to try to forget anything you may have read or heard about OKR’s, and consider the points in this series of articles with an open mind, and see if they make sense to you._

Now that we know what actions we need each product team to pursue, we need to discuss how we assign this work in such a way as to _empower_ the team.

The essential point of team objectives is to _empower_ a team by a) giving them a _problem to solve_ rather than a feature to build; and b) ensuring they have the necessary [strategic context](https://svpg.com/coaching-strategic-context/) to understand the _why_ , and to make good decisions.

The most important point to understand about team objectives is that first and foremost, they are intended to give the product team the space to come up with solutions to hard and important problems.

This is in stark contrast to a typical product roadmap which is providing the team with a prioritized list of features and projects to build. If those features or projects do not solve the underlying problems, then we fail, even though we may have delivered what we were asked to build.

_Assigning Problems To Solve, Rather Than Features To Build_

Some people believe that the difference is not such a big deal. If you think you need your team to build an app, then just tell them to build the app, rather than providing them the business and strategic context, and letting them figure out we need to build an app.

But one of the major lessons our industry has learned, is how work is assigned matters. 

David Marquet, a long-time advocate for empowered teams and author of the recent book [Leadership is Language](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/555238/leadership-is-language-by-l-david-marquet/), argues “even when you want to be a more collaborative leader, you can undermine your own efforts by defaulting to command-and-control language we’ve inherited from the industrial era.”

There are many reasons why this is preferred, but the most important are:

  * The best people to determine the most appropriate solution are those closest to the problem, with the necessary skills – the _product team_.
  * We want the team to take responsibility for achieving the desired _outcome_.
  * If we tell the team the feature we want them to build, then if that feature doesn’t provide the necessary results, we can’t hold the team _accountable_.
  * If we give the team the problem to solve, and the space to solve it in the best way they see fit, the product team will feel much more _ownership_ of the problem.
  * If the first solution the team comes up with does not produce the desired outcome, they know they must continue to _iterate_ until they do find a solution that does.



So Team Objectives are comprised of an objective (the problem that needs to be solved) and some measures of progress (the key results). Let’s discuss each.

_Objectives_

The specific objectives will of course be a function of the type of product and the responsibilities of the particular product team, but typical examples of _good_ objectives are:

  * Reduce the frequency of parcels delivered to the wrong address.
  * Increase the percentage of shipments delivered with next day delivery.
  * Reduce the percentage of images flagged as inappropriate.
  * Reduce the subscriber churn rate.
  * Demonstrate product/market fit for an existing product in a new market.
  * Decrease the time it takes a job seeker to find a new job.
  * Reduce the operational costs of fulfillment.
  * Reduce the cost to acquire a new customer.
  * Increase the lifetime value of the customer.
  * Reduce the percentage of customers that require customer service assistance.
  * Reduce the average time spent handling a customer service call.
  * Increase the percentage of new customers that successfully create an account.
  * Reduce the time for a user to produce their first monthly report.
  * Reduce the time required to deploy a new or updated service to production.
  * Improve the site availability.



What’s most important about all of these examples is that they are _problems to solve,_ and not features to build. 

Some are _customer_ problems and some are _business_ problems, but in each case, there are any number of potential solutions. The point is that the product team is best suited to determine the most appropriate solution.

Notice also the example objectives are all qualitative. The quantitative dimension will be discussed in the key results.

It’s also important to acknowledge here that many of the most important objectives will require the product team to either collaborate with other product teams, or in many cases, to collaborate with different parts of the organization to achieve the goal. That is not only ok, but very much intended, although in practice this clearly depends on having a product manager on the product team that has a deep understanding of the business.

_Key Results_

While the objective is the problem to solve, the key results tell us how we define success.

And it’s essential that we define success by _business results_(aka outcome), and not simply activity or output.

The second most common reason that teams go wrong with OKR’s is that they end up listing activities or deliverables as their key results. Hopefully this is clear to you at this point, but just in case it’s not, the reason this is so much of a problem is that it is very easy to ship a deliverable, yet not solve the underlying problem. In which case, we’re back to the same old problem we have with product roadmaps.

Generally speaking, we want two key results for each objective. The first key result is the primary measure. The second key result is a measure of quality, sometimes called a “backstop,” to ensure that the first key result is not inadvertently achieved by hurting something else.

For example, suppose we consider the objective of:

  * Reduce the frequency of parcels delivered to the wrong address.



Now, the primary key result would likely be the actual percentage of incorrect deliveries. But if we were to achieve that by burdening the ordering and fulfillment process, it’s possible to reduce the percentage, but also significantly reduce the absolute number of deliveries, which would not be a helpful solution. So, potential key results could be measured by:

  * Reduce percentage of incorrect deliveries
  * While ensuring that total deliveries continues to grow



Notice that while these key results do imply specific KPI’s, we don’t yet have the expected values or timeframes, because those will need to come _from the team_.

The reason for that is that if we were to provide to the team explicit measures of success including time frame, they won’t feel that _ownership_ over the commitment that we want in an empowered team. So the actual quantitative values will come from the teams.

It’s also important to note that sometimes the most appropriate measure of success or KPI is not yet clear, especially in the case where it’s a problem we haven’t worked on before. In this case, the team may need some time to better understand the dynamics and the most appropriate measures. 

A related issue is to be sure the team is not “letting the tail wag the dog.” What that means is that sometimes a team will be tempted to define their key results by something that is easy to measure, rather than what’s most _meaningful_ to measure.

_Sharing Strategic Context_

If we are to give product teams the space to solve hard problems, we must also provide these teams with the context necessary to make good decisions.

We need to share the [strategic context](http://www.svpg.com/coaching-strategic-context), especially the [product strategy](http://www.svpg.com/product-strategy-overview), with the product teams for four main reasons:

First, it’s critical that the team has a deep understanding of the ultimate goal, and _why_ this is an important problem to solve.

Second, we want teams to start thinking about how they each might be able to contribute to solving the key problems.

Third, we want the teams to start thinking through the implications of the upcoming work. Perhaps there are dependencies that are not immediately visible. Or technologies or skills that we will need to acquire.

Fourth, we love it when teams express a special interest in working on specific problems. We can’t always accommodate every team working on the problems they request, but we are certainly motivated to try.

With these principles in mind, we’re now ready to [assign](http://www.svpg.com/team-objectives-action) objectives to specific product teams.

# Team Objectives – Management

Continuing on our series on team objectives, once product teams have their team objectives for the quarter and are pursuing, active management will still be needed.

Much as the product strategy requires ongoing tracking and managing by the product leaders, the team objectives require ongoing tracking and managing by the product team.

_Keep The Lights On Work_

Remember that the team objectives are not the only work that a product team is responsible for. We also have the “keep the lights on” or “business as usual” work we discussed earlier. We do need to keep an eye on this ongoing work if it spikes, the team won’t be able to make much progress on their team objectives.

_Weekly Tracking_

The key is to make sure the product teams are actively managing the progress on the team objectives, otherwise it is all too possible that weeks and then months will fly by with little progress.

At a minimum, the product teams stay on top of progress by discussing at weekly check-ins where they are, what is upcoming, and where they might need help. These weekly OKR check-ins are the key mechanism that teams use to track and manage their own progress. 

_Resolving Conflicts_

Occasionally the teams will raise an issue that requires the leaders to coordinate to resolve conflicts or issues. There are different schools of thought on the meetings that leaders can use to manage these issues, but our focus is for issues to be actively managed, decisions made promptly, and large group meetings minimized.

_Staying On Track_

However, there’s two caveats here. First, it’s critical that each member of the product team is getting the ongoing coaching they need to develop. And some of that coaching will pertain to the OKR related issues they face. 

Second, the product manager specifically needs to be communicating with her manager about any important issues so that the manager can have the chance to provide assistance where possible.

If the team determines they need the assistance of management, then the sooner this need is raised the better chance management has of helping in a timely and effective manner. 

It’s also an important obligation to alert management as early as possible in the event that there is a question as to the team’s ability to deliver on a high-integrity commitment.

Similarly, if there is a dependency, such as on another product team, this dependency will need to be managed and tracked carefully. If they are a dependency for another team, then they will need to keep this in mind and ensure this work is completed in time for the team that is depending on them.

_Helping Our Colleagues_

While so much of empowered product teams is about optimizing for the product teams, it’s also important to recognize that we often will need to help our colleagues on other product teams out, and we very likely have situations where we will depend on them helping us out as well.

The best product teams know that when it comes to tech companies, we either all succeed or none of us succeed. And it’s not unusual to find yourself in the situation where you believe you must do something that’s not in the best interest of your product team, but you see that it is in the best interest of the customer and of the broader organization.

# Team Objectives – Summary

We need some way to assign and manage work to product teams, and we want to do this in a way that is empowering and executes on our product strategy. This is the purpose of Team Objectives. Assuming you have embraced the empowered product team model, and you have capable leaders, it is fairly straightforward. 

Here are the most important keys to effective team objectives:

  1. The most important thing is to empower teams by assigning them _problems to solve_ , and then give the teams the space to solve them. In order to make good decisions, they will also need you to share the [strategic context](https://svpg.com/coaching-strategic-context/), including the[ strategic focus](http://www.svpg.com/product-strategy-focus) and the[ strategic insights](http://www.svpg.com/product-strategy-insights).
  2. We love it when product teams volunteer to work on specific objectives, and we try to accommodate this when possible to leverage their motivation and enthusiasm for the problem, but we can’t always do so because we need to make sure we cover everything we need to.
  3. Selecting the objectives to be worked on, and ultimately deciding which team or teams works on each objective, is _the explicit responsibility of product leadership_. However, and this is critically important for empowerment, _the key results need to come from the team_.
  4. It’s normal that there’s a back and forth – not that the leaders are doubting or questioning what the teams propose as their key results, but rather judging which investments are worth the effort and associated risk. For example, suppose a team believes that with their other objectives, they can only make a very minimal improvement to a specific important KPI. The leaders might consider having that team focus exclusively on the one objective, or decide to ask a different team to pursue or help.
  5. There is nothing wrong with assigning the same objective to multiple teams, each approaching the problem in its own way. In fact, for difficult product problems, this is often a very effective technique. On hard problems, we expect that not all teams will make the same level of progress, and we can’t anticipate in advance what the teams will learn when they each get deep into their product discovery work.
  6. Similarly, there is nothing wrong with asking multiple teams to collaborate on the same objective. Especially when the problem requires different sets of skills, it’s not unusual to ask multiple teams to work together. A common situation is asking a platform team and an experience team to collaborate on a difficult problem.
  7. In order for product teams to come up with key results, it’s essential that they understand the level of _ambition_ you are looking for from them. We need to be clear with teams when we want them to be very ambitious (aka “moon shot”); when we want them to be conservative (aka “roof shot”); and when we need them to make an actual[ high-integrity commitment](https://svpg.com/managing-commitments-in-an-agile-team/).
  8. Product teams can only be accountable to the results if they are empowered to figure out a solution that works; and if they are the ones to come up with the key results.
  9. The product leaders have to realize that while team objectives are critically important, they are not the only things that the product team is working on. Every team has some level of ongoing “business as usual” or “keep the lights on” activities. Fixing critical bugs, handling customer situations, etc. 
  10. Normally these team objectives are created or updated every quarter. That gives teams enough time to make real progress, yet not too much time that the business can’t adjust to changes. There may be occasional situations where team objectives need to change _during_ the quarter, but these should be the exception rather than the rule.



To keep all this in perspective, remember that the essence of this is simply having a knowledgeable leader sit down with the product team, and explain the strategic context, and then explain the problem you need the team to solve, and how success is measured. 

Whether you use a formal technique like OKR’s to do this is much less important; the key is to have this conversation, and for the leaders to give the product teams the space to solve the problems in the best way they see fit.
