## Deep Dive Comparison

### 1. Fundamental Philosophy

#### Christina Wodtke
**Core Belief:** "OKRs are a commitment system, not a control system."

**Key Principles:**
- OKRs empower teams with autonomy
- Focus on **learning** through rapid feedback cycles
- Weekly rhythm transforms goals into habits
- **Simplicity** - one OKR set for small teams
- Trust teams to find their own path

**Quote:**
> "OKRs are about focus, not control. They work best when teams have the autonomy to figure out HOW."

---

#### Rick Klau
**Core Belief:** "OKRs impose discipline on the organization."

**Key Principles:**
- OKRs create **transparency** across the org
- Help understand what you're working on AND what you're NOT
- Public OKRs enable coordination
- **Measurability** is non-negotiable
- Grade to learn, not to punish

**Quote:**
> "OKRs help me individually understand what I'm working on and why. Just as importantly, they help me make conscious decisions about what I'm NOT working on."

---

**Comparison:**
- **Wodtke:** Emphasizes autonomy and empowerment
- **Klau:** Emphasizes alignment and transparency
- **Both:** Value focus and saying "no"
- **Difference:** Wodtke is more about team independence, Klau about organizational coordination

---

### 2. OKR Structure & Format

#### Christina Wodtke

**Objectives:**
- Set at **5/10 confidence** (50/50 chance of success)
- Inspirational and qualitative
- Should make you uncomfortable
- Focus on change, not maintenance

**Key Results:**
- Measure **outcomes**, never tasks
- Usually 3-5 per objective
- Must be measurable (numbers)
- Change over time (metrics move)

**Example:**
```
Objective: Delight customers with a game-changing search experience

Key Results:
- Increase search usage from 25% to 40% of sessions
- Reduce average search time from 30s to 10s
- Improve search satisfaction score from 3.2 to 4.5
```

**Structure:**
- 1 OKR set for small teams (< 20 people)
- 2-3 OKR sets for larger organizations
- Keep it simple, avoid over-engineering

---

#### Rick Klau

**Objectives:**
- Should feel **uncomfortable** at quarter start
- Qualitative direction
- You should be uncertain if achievable
- If certain, you're not thinking big enough

**Key Results:**
- **"It's not a key result unless it has a number"** (Marissa Mayer)
- Must be objectively gradable
- Lead to measurable proof of progress
- Connect to objectives

**Example:**
```
Objective: Accelerate Revenue Growth (Blogger)

Key Results:
- Launch monetized tab
- Increase RPMs by 20% through placement targeting
- Launch 3 revenue experiments to learn drivers
- Finalize PRD for Ad Network + secure eng allocation
```

**Structure:**
- 3-5 objectives per person/team
- Company, Team, and Individual levels
- All interconnected but not everyone's OKRs in company OKRs

---

**Comparison:**
- **Wodtke:** 5/10 confidence (more specific)
- **Klau:** "Uncomfortable" (more qualitative)
- **Wodtke:** Outcomes over outputs (strong emphasis)
- **Klau:** Numbers required (Marissa Mayer rule)
- **Both:** Measurable, ambitious, focused

**Key Difference:**
Wodtke is more explicit about outcomes vs. outputs. Klau emphasizes the number requirement but Rick's 2022 update adds more focus on outcomes over activity.

---

### 3. Grading & Measurement

#### Christina Wodtke

**Approach:**
- Less emphasis on numerical grading
- More focus on **learning** from wins and losses
- Friday Celebrations to review progress
- Quarterly retrospectives

**Scoring Philosophy:**
- Not central to her methodology
- When used: 0-1 scale, aiming for 0.6-0.7
- More important: "What did we learn?"
- Focus on **continuous improvement**

**Weekly Rhythm:**
- **Monday:** Commitments (what will we do this week?)
- **Friday:** Celebrations (what did we accomplish?)
- This creates learning cycles, not just measurement

**Quote:**
> "The weekly rhythm is what makes OKRs work. Without it, they're just aspirational statements."

---

#### Rick Klau

**Approach:**
- **Central to methodology**
- 0.0 to 1.0 scale
- Target: 0.6-0.7 (60-70%)
- Quarterly grading with public company meetings

**Scoring Philosophy:**
- **0.4 or below:** Problematic, missed entirely
- **0.6-0.7:** Sweet spot, good performance
- **0.8+:** Goals too conservative, sandbagging
- **1.0:** Only for binary goals fully achieved

**Grading as Learning:**
> "Grades don't matter except as directional indicators. Low scores benefit everyone more because they tell you what NOT to do."

**Process:**
- End of quarter: grade all OKRs
- Company meeting: present grades publicly
- Explain WHY you got that grade
- Share learnings
- Inform next quarter's OKRs

---

**Comparison:**
- **Wodtke:** Weekly learning cycles (Monday/Friday)
- **Klau:** Quarterly grading with public review
- **Wodtke:** De-emphasizes numerical scores
- **Klau:** Numerical grading is core practice
- **Both:** Use scores for learning, not punishment

**Key Insight:**
- Wodtke: **Higher frequency, lighter weight** (weekly check-ins)
- Klau: **Lower frequency, heavier weight** (quarterly deep dives)
- Both work; choose based on team needs

---

### 4. Cadence & Rhythm

#### Christina Wodtke

**Weekly Cadence (Signature Practice):**

**Monday Commitments:**
- Team meets to plan the week
- What will we do to move OKRs forward?
- Commit to specific tasks
- Surface blockers early

**Friday Celebrations:**
- Review what was accomplished
- Celebrate wins (even small ones)
- Discuss what didn't work
- Adjust for next week

**Why This Works:**
- Creates feedback loops
- Builds culture of learning
- Makes OKRs a living practice
- Prevents "set and forget"

**Quarterly:**
- Set new OKRs
- Retrospective on last quarter
- But weekly rhythm is where the magic happens

**Quote:**
> "Cadence is king. Without the weekly rhythm, OKRs are just nice-to-have goals that sit in a drawer."

---

#### Rick Klau

**Quarterly Cadence (Google's Practice):**

**Start of Quarter:**
- Company meeting presenting OKRs
- Individual OKRs finalized
- All OKRs published internally

**Mid-Quarter:**
- One-on-one check-ins with managers
- Reality check: "Am I on track?"
- Recalibrate if needed
- Adjust priorities

**End of Quarter:**
- Grade OKRs
- Company meeting to review grades
- Present learnings
- Set next quarter's OKRs

**Annual:**
- Set annual OKRs (flexible, can revise)
- Not written in stone
- Directional aids

**Quote:**
> "At least once or twice in a quarter, there should be a meeting where everyone has gone through the exercise of saying: 'This is what I said I'd be doing. Am I in the ballpark?'"

---

**Comparison:**
- **Wodtke:** Weekly rhythm is THE differentiator
- **Klau:** Quarterly cycle with mid-quarter check-ins
- **Wodtke:** Builds habits through repetition
- **Klau:** More suited to large organizations

**When to Use Which:**
- **Weekly (Wodtke):** Small teams, startups, fast-moving products
- **Quarterly (Klau):** Larger orgs, enterprise, more stable environments
- **Hybrid:** Many companies do both - weekly team check-ins + quarterly company reviews

---

### 5. Transparency & Communication

#### Christina Wodtke

**Approach:**
- OKRs should be visible to team
- Focus on **alignment** not approval
- **Decoupling** (2024 evolution): less bureaucracy, more trust
- Share strategy clearly, trust teams to align

**Decoupling Philosophy:**
- Don't require approval of OKRs from management
- Share company strategy clearly
- Teams self-align to strategy
- Reduces bottlenecks
- Requires high trust environment

**Communication Style:**
- Weekly team meetings (Monday/Friday)
- OKRs visible to relevant stakeholders
- Less emphasis on company-wide transparency
- More focus on team autonomy

**Evolution:**
- **2014:** Cascading (top-down)
- **2020:** Alignment (negotiation)
- **2024:** Decoupling (trust-based)

---

#### Rick Klau

**Approach:**
- **Public OKRs are non-negotiable**
- Everyone can see everyone's OKRs (CEO to intern)
- Linked in employee directory
- Can see current AND historical OKRs

**Why Public Matters:**
- **Coordination:** Know what others are working on
- **Efficiency:** Don't pitch conflicting ideas
- **Alignment:** See how your work connects
- **Accountability:** Social pressure to deliver

**Communication Style:**
- Quarterly company-wide meetings
- Public grading sessions
- Leadership presents company OKRs
- Team owners present team OKRs

**Google's Practice:**
- Every quarter, CEO presents company OKRs
- VPs present their team's OKRs and grades
- Transparent about wins AND failures
- Creates culture of openness

**Quote:**
> "These [OKRs] cannot be siloed. It is critical for everyone in the organization to know what everyone else is working on. That's true from the CEO on down."

---

**Comparison:**
- **Wodtke:** Transparency within relevant teams, decoupled approval
- **Klau:** Total transparency across entire organization
- **Wodtke:** Trust over control
- **Klau:** Transparency for coordination
- **Both:** Value open communication

**Cultural Fit:**
- **Wodtke's approach:** Better for smaller, high-trust environments
- **Klau's approach:** Better for large organizations needing coordination
- **Neither is wrong:** Choose based on org size and culture

---

### 6. Relationship to Performance Reviews

#### Christina Wodtke

**Position:**
- OKRs should NOT be used for performance reviews
- Separates goals from compensation
- Allows for risk-taking
- Focus on learning, not judgment

**Why Separation Matters:**
- If tied to reviews, people sandbag
- Kills innovation
- Makes goals "safe" instead of "stretch"

**Mentioned but not heavily emphasized in main articles**

---

#### Rick Klau

**Position (Especially after 2022 update):**
- **"Should be shouted from the rafters"**
- OKRs completely separate from performance evaluations
- At Google, NOT factored into annual reviews

**Why This is CRITICAL:**
> "If you use OKRs as a performance review, you're going to encourage your teams to sandbag their OKRs, and set entirely achievable goals so they can get their bonus."

**The Tension:**
- OKRs target 60-70% achievement
- Performance reviews want 100% achievement
- These are fundamentally incompatible

**How Rick Used OKRs in Reviews:**
- CAN include as context in self-review
- Helpful to recall what you worked on
- But NOT a direct scoring input

**Quote:**
> "At no point in time were my quarterly OKR bullets factored into my annual evaluation."

---

**Comparison:**
- **Wodtke:** Mentions separation, not heavily emphasized
- **Klau:** Made it a central pillar in 2022 update
- **Both:** Agree OKRs ≠ performance reviews
- **Klau:** More explicit and emphatic about this

**Practical Implication:**
- If you're implementing OKRs, follow Klau's emphasis
- Make separation crystal clear from day one
- Otherwise people WILL sandbag

---

### 7. Individual vs. Team vs. Company OKRs

#### Christina Wodtke

**Structure:**
- **Small teams (< 20):** One OKR set for entire team
- **Larger orgs:** Company + Team OKRs
- **Individual OKRs:** Optional, often discouraged

**Philosophy:**
- Individual OKRs can be confusing
- Often just repeat job duties
- Team OKRs create collaboration
- Company OKRs provide direction

**When Individual OKRs Work:**
- For individual contributors with unique goals
- Growth/development objectives
- Personal skill-building
- But not required for everyone

**Emphasis on Team:**
- OKRs should foster collaboration
- Individual OKRs can create silos
- Better to have team members contribute to team OKRs

---

#### Rick Klau

**Structure (Three Levels):**

**1. Company OKRs (3-5 max)**
- Set by CEO, board, leadership
- Most important things for company
- Example: "Win the Super Bowl" (49ers GM)

**2. Team OKRs**
- Priorities for team as unit
- NOT just bucket of personal OKRs
- Example: "Offensive Coordinator's goals"

**3. Personal OKRs (3-5 objectives)**
- What YOU are working on
- Negotiated with manager
- Should connect to team/company goals

**Connection:**
- Not every personal OKR appears in company OKRs
- But personal OKRs should support company objectives
- Like football team: GM → Coach → Coordinators → Players

**Evolution (2022 Update):**
- Now recommends SKIPPING individual OKRs initially
- Start with company and team only
- Individual OKRs can be confusing/frustrating
- Make them optional

**Quote from 2022:**
> "Ignore individual OKRs when first implementing the framework. They can be confusing/frustrating and potentially redundant."

---

**Comparison:**
- **Wodtke:** Always skeptical of individual OKRs
- **Klau (2013):** Three levels standard at Google
- **Klau (2022):** Evolved to Wodtke's position - skip individual OKRs initially
- **Both (current):** Start with company/team, add individual later if needed

**Convergence:**
Both experts evolved to similar view: team and company OKRs are more valuable than individual OKRs for most organizations.

---

### 8. Common Mistakes & Anti-Patterns

#### Christina Wodtke

**Top Mistakes:**

**1. Cargo Cult OKRs**
- Copying Google without understanding principles
- Using OKR software before understanding methodology
- "We have OKRs" but no real change

**2. Activity-Based Key Results**
- Measuring tasks, not outcomes
- "Ship 3 features" instead of "Increase engagement 30%"
- Removes team's ability to innovate

**3. Using Without Prerequisites**
- No strategy
- No team autonomy
- No control over priorities
- Teams without these shouldn't use OKRs

**4. Too Many OKRs**
- Can't focus on everything
- Human working memory: 3-5 items
- More than that = no real priorities

**5. No Weekly Cadence**
- Set and forget
- Check in only quarterly
- OKRs become stale

**Warning:**
> "If your teams don't have autonomy, don't use OKRs. You'll frustrate everyone and waste time."

---

#### Rick Klau

**Top Mistakes:**

**1. Not Saying No Clearly Enough** (2022 update)
- Treating all priorities as equal
- Not explicitly identifying what you're NOT working on
- Good ideas become distractions

**2. Focusing on Activity Instead of Impact** (2022 update)
- Key results measure "doing stuff" not outcomes
- Metrics disconnected from goals
- Can achieve goals without business impact

**3. Using OKRs for Performance Reviews**
- Kills ambition
- Encourages sandbagging
- Defeats the purpose

**4. OKRs That Can Be Gamed** (2022 Red Team concept)
- Can achieve good grades without business progress
- No quality gates
- Example: "Launch 5 features" could be junk features

**5. Too Many Objectives**
- Rick's worst quarter: 7 objectives = exhausted
- Recommendation: 3-5 max
- Stuffing each objective with 12 key results

**6. Editing OKRs Mid-Quarter**
- Erases institutional memory
- Loses learnings
- Can't understand what was tried

---

**Comparison:**
- **Wodtke:** Focuses on lack of prerequisites (strategy, autonomy)
- **Klau:** Focuses on execution issues (gaming, sandbagging)
- **Both:** Warn against activity metrics
- **Both:** Emphasize focus (too many = failure)

**Key Difference:**
- Wodtke asks: "Should you even use OKRs?"
- Klau assumes: "How do you use OKRs correctly?"

---

### 9. When NOT to Use OKRs

#### Christina Wodtke

**Don't Use OKRs If:**

**1. No Strategy**
- OKRs execute strategy
- Without strategy, OKRs are random
- First, figure out where you're going

**2. No Team Autonomy**
- Teams told exactly what to do
- No room for creative problem-solving
- OKRs become micromanagement

**3. No Control Over Priorities**
- Service teams
- Maintenance crews
- Highly dependent teams
- Better off with project management

**4. No Commitment to Cadence**
- Won't do weekly check-ins
- Leadership won't engage
- Set it and forget it mentality

**5. Company Too Small or Too Early**
- Very early startups (< 5 people)
- Everything is firefighting
- Wait until you have some stability

**Alternative Approaches:**
- Project management (Jira, etc.)
- Kanban for maintenance teams
- Sprint goals for Agile teams
- Simple to-do lists

**Quote:**
> "If your teams don't have the autonomy to figure out HOW to achieve goals, OKRs will only frustrate everyone."

---

#### Rick Klau

**Position:**
- **"As soon as possible"**
- Even works for team of one (Rick does it himself)
- Discipline is valuable at any size

**When to Delay:**
- No explicit "don't use" scenarios in original content
- Assumes OKRs are broadly applicable

**Caveats:**
- Need commitment from leadership
- Needs to be transparent
- Requires regular grading
- Can't be half-hearted

**Quote:**
> "Even if it feels a little artificial if you're a company of five, the discipline that it brings is immeasurable."

---

**Comparison:**
- **Wodtke:** Has clear "don't use" scenarios
- **Klau:** More universally bullish on OKRs
- **Wodtke:** Emphasizes prerequisites
- **Klau:** Emphasizes commitment

**Practical Guidance:**
- Follow Wodtke's prerequisites checklist first
- If you pass, follow Klau's "start ASAP" advice
- If you fail prerequisites, fix those first

---

---

### 11. Tools & Systems

#### Christina Wodtke

**Approach:**
- **Keep it simple**
- Avoid OKR software early on
- Can lead to cargo cult behavior

**Recommended Tools:**
- Spreadsheets
- Docs
- Wiki
- Physical boards
- Whiteboard + sticky notes

**Software When Ready:**
- After you understand methodology
- When process is working
- To scale, not to start
- Tool should match your process

**Weekly Rhythm Tools:**
- Monday meeting agenda
- Friday wins doc
- Shared spreadsheet for tracking

**Warning:**
> "Don't buy OKR software before you understand OKRs. You'll just automate bad process."

---

#### Rick Klau

**Approach:**
- Google built custom tool
- But it's just text fields + average button
- "Really sophisticated math" (sarcasm)

**Recommended Tools:**
- **Google Sites** - Page per quarter
- **Wiki** - Flexible, easy to edit
- **Google Docs** - Works but unwieldy
- **Google Spreadsheets** - Good for calculations
- **Simple Rails app** - Text fields + username

**What Matters MORE Than Tool:**
1. Commitment to being measurable
2. Transparency - everyone can see
3. Grading process
4. Tool itself matters LESS

**Quote:**
> "The keys are not the tool. It's the commitment to being measurable, the transparency, and the grading process."

---

**Comparison:**
- **Both:** Keep tools simple
- **Both:** Process matters more than software
- **Wodtke:** More skeptical of OKR software
- **Klau:** More pragmatic - use what works
- **Agreement:** Don't over-engineer

---

## Key Quotes Comparison

### On Focus

**Wodtke:**
> "OKRs are about focus, not control. The goal is strategic alignment with tactical autonomy."

**Klau:**
> "OKRs help me individually understand what I'm working on and why. Just as importantly, they help me understand what I'm NOT going to be working on."

**Synthesis:** Focus requires both knowing what to do AND what not to do, with autonomy on HOW.

---

### On Ambition

**Wodtke:**
> "Set OKRs at 5/10 confidence level - a 50/50 chance of success."

**Klau:**
> "If you are certain you will nail it, you're not pushing hard enough. You're not thinking broadly enough. You're not thinking big."

**Synthesis:** Both want stretch goals; Wodtke quantifies it (5/10), Klau describes it (uncomfortable).

---

### On Measurement

**Wodtke:**
> "Key Results must measure outcomes, not outputs. This allows teams to pivot tactics while staying focused on results."

**Klau (via Marissa Mayer):**
> "It's not a key result unless it has a number."

**Synthesis:** Numbers are required (Klau), but they must measure outcomes not activities (Wodtke).

---

### On Learning

**Wodtke:**
> "The weekly rhythm is what transforms OKRs from goal-setting to goal-achieving. Regular check-ins create learning organizations."

**Klau:**
> "Low scores aren't failure. They tell you what to stop doing, what to change, what to continue doing more of."

**Synthesis:** Learning happens through regular feedback (Wodtke) and honest assessment (Klau).

---

### On Performance Reviews

**Wodtke:**
> "OKRs should NOT be used for performance reviews. Separates goals from compensation, allows for risk-taking."

**Klau (2022 update):**
> "If you use OKRs as a performance review, you're going to encourage your teams to sandbag their OKRs, and set entirely achievable goals so they can get their bonus. This should be shouted from the rafters."

**Synthesis:** Both agree completely - this separation is critical.

---

### On Simplicity

**Wodtke:**
> "One OKR set for small businesses, minimal cascading, avoid over-complication."

**Klau:**
> "The keys are not the tool. It's the commitment to being measurable, the transparency, and the grading process."

**Synthesis:** Keep the system simple, focus on principles over process.

## What Marty Cagan Would Add

**Note:** Marty Cagan (author of "Inspired," "Empowered") approaches OKRs from a product management perspective. While he supports outcome-based approaches, he has nuanced views:

### Cagan's Perspective on OKRs:

**1. Product Teams Over Projects**
- Teams own problems, not features
- OKRs should define outcomes, not roadmaps
- Teams figure out solutions

**2. Continuous Discovery**
- Weekly testing with customers
- OKRs inform discovery, not replace it
- Build/measure/learn cycles

**3. Empowered Teams**
- Give teams problems to solve
- OKRs set destination, not path
- Trust teams to find the way

**4. Dual-Track Agile**
- Discovery track (what to build)
- Delivery track (building it)
- OKRs guide discovery

### How Cagan Would Enhance This Comparison:

**What He'd Emphasize:**
- Product discovery discipline
- Customer validation
- Problem-centric (not solution-centric)
- Team empowerment
- Product/tech/design collaboration

**Where He'd Align:**
- With Wodtke on autonomy and outcomes
- With both on separating OKRs from performance
- With both on measuring outcomes not outputs

**Where He'd Differ:**
- Less emphasis on grading (not central to his framework)
- More emphasis on continuous customer testing
- Product team structure over hierarchical OKRs

**Resources:**
- "Inspired" - Product teams and empowerment
- "Empowered" - Product operating model

## Summary Matrix

| Factor | Wodtke | Klau | Best For You |
|--------|--------|------|--------------|
| **Team Size** | 5-50 optimal | 50-30,000+ | Check your size |
| **Cadence** | Weekly | Quarterly | Weekly for small, both for large |
| **Transparency** | Team-level | Company-wide | Depends on trust level |
| **Individual OKRs** | Skip them | Skip initially (updated) | Start without, add if needed |
| **Grading** | De-emphasized | Central practice | Use if data-driven culture |
| **Prerequisites** | Explicit checklist | Assumes readiness | Use checklist first |
| **Trust Level** | High trust required | Builds through transparency | Both are valid paths |
| **Learning Focus** | Weekly iterations | Quarterly retrospectives | Weekly better for speed |
| **Simplicity** | Maximum | Moderate | Keep it simple |
| **Innovation** | Monday/Friday rhythm | Red Team reviews | Use both! |

## Action Plan: Implementing with Both Frameworks

### Phase 1: Assessment (Week 1)
- [ ] Review Wodtke's prerequisites checklist
  - Do we have a strategy?
  - Do teams have autonomy?
  - Do teams control their priorities?
- [ ] Assess organizational readiness
- [ ] Decide on transparency level (team vs. company-wide)
- [ ] Choose initial scope (company + team OKRs, skip individual)

### Phase 2: Foundation (Weeks 2-3)
- [ ] Draft company OKRs (leadership)
- [ ] Use Klau's football team model to visualize levels
- [ ] Use Wodtke's 5/10 confidence test
- [ ] Apply Klau's Red Team review
- [ ] Ensure all KRs measure outcomes (Wodtke emphasis)
- [ ] Ensure all KRs have numbers (Klau emphasis)

### Phase 3: Communication (Week 4)
- [ ] Company meeting presenting OKRs (Klau)
- [ ] Explain separation from performance reviews (both)
- [ ] Set up simple tool (both recommend simple)
- [ ] Make OKRs public (Klau's level appropriate to size)

### Phase 4: Execution (Weeks 5-12)
- [ ] Weekly Monday Commitments (Wodtke)
- [ ] Weekly Friday Celebrations (Wodtke)
- [ ] Mid-quarter check-ins (Klau)
- [ ] Keep OKRs visible and referenced

### Phase 5: Learning (Week 13)
- [ ] Grade OKRs (Klau's 0.6-0.7 target)
- [ ] Quarterly retrospective (both)
- [ ] Present grades publicly (Klau)
- [ ] Document learnings (Klau's institutional memory)
- [ ] Don't edit original OKRs (Klau)

### Phase 6: Iteration (Week 14+)
- [ ] Draft next quarter's OKRs
- [ ] Apply learnings
- [ ] Gradually add Wodtke's decoupling if trust is high
- [ ] Continue weekly rhythm

## Conclusion

**Christina Wodtke** and **Rick Klau** both offer battle-tested OKR frameworks, refined over 13-15 years each. Rather than choosing one, savvy organizations take the best of both:

**From Wodtke:**
- Weekly rhythm that makes OKRs alive
- Clear prerequisites before starting
- Trust-based decoupling for mature organizations
- Simplicity and team autonomy

**From Klau:**
- Transparency for coordination
- Grading discipline for learning
- Institutional memory for compounding value
- Red Team reviews for quality

**The synthesis:**
Use Wodtke's prerequisites to decide IF you should use OKRs. Use Wodtke's weekly rhythm to make them work. Use Klau's transparency and grading to scale them. Use both's emphasis on outcomes to make them valuable.

**Both experts have evolved toward:**
- Skipping individual OKRs initially
- Emphasizing outcomes over outputs
- Separating from performance reviews
- Simplifying the system
- Building cultures of learning

**Start here:**
1. Read Wodtke's "Are You Sure You Want OKRs?" - Check prerequisites
2. Watch Klau's 2013 video - Understand the full system
3. Read both's 2022-2025 updates - Get their evolved thinking
4. Start simple - Company + Team OKRs only
5. Weekly rhythm (Wodtke) + Quarterly reviews (Klau)
6. Iterate based on learnings

**The magic is in the combination, not the choice.**
