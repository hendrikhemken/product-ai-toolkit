## The Third Way: Cagan's Team Objectives

**When Wodtke AND Klau Don't Fit: Consider Marty Cagan's Alternative**

### Who Is This For?

**Feature Teams Transitioning to Product Teams:**
- Currently executing roadmaps (not discovering solutions)
- Low autonomy environment
- Leadership doesn't provide clear strategy
- Traditional OKRs will fail (waste of time)

**Marty Cagan's Strong Warning:**
> "After many years of being a very vocal advocate for OKRs, in the majority of companies I meet, I have stopped recommending the practice."

### Why Traditional OKRs Fail (Cagan's Analysis)

**Problem 1: Feature Teams vs Product Teams**
- OKRs designed for empowered product teams
- Most companies still use feature teams
- Cultural mismatch = waste of time

**Problem 2: Manager Objectives Dilute Focus**
- Engineering Manager has OKRs
- Product Manager has OKRs
- Design Manager has OKRs
- → Team members work on DIFFERENT objectives
- → No collaboration on shared goals

**Problem 3: Leadership Missing in Action**
- Think empowerment = less management
- No product strategy provided
- Teams pick random objectives
- → OKRs become wish lists

---

### Team Objectives: The Alternative

**What Makes It Different:**

| Aspect | Traditional OKRs | Cagan's Team Objectives |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Focus** | Goal achievement | Empowerment FIRST |
| **Level** | Company, Team, Individual | **Team only** |
| **Manager OKRs** | Often cascaded down | **None** |
| **Individual OKRs** | Common practice | **None** |
| **Leadership Role** | Varies | **Active** (provides problems) |
| **Team Role** | Executes on objectives | **Discovers** solutions |
| **Prerequisites** | Helpful but not enforced | **Mandatory** |

**Key Principle:**
> "Leadership gives PROBLEMS, teams find SOLUTIONS"

---

### When to Use Team Objectives Instead of OKRs

**✅ Use Team Objectives When:**

1. **Feature Team (for now)**
   - Still transitioning to product teams
   - Can't do full OKR framework yet
   - Need simpler starting point

2. **Missing Prerequisites**
   - No clear product strategy
   - Leadership not ready for active role
   - Cross-functional teams not fully formed

3. **Want Empowerment Focus**
   - Empowerment is THE goal
   - OKRs would be premature
   - Need to build culture first

4. **Previous OKR Failure**
   - Tried OKRs, didn't work
   - Was cargo cult / theater
   - Need different approach

**❌ Don't Use Team Objectives If:**
- Already have empowered product teams (use Wodtke/Klau)
- Leadership provides strong strategy (use OKRs)
- Want institutional memory building (OKRs better)
- Need coordination at scale (Klau's approach better)

---

### How Team Objectives Work

**Step 1: Leadership Provides Problems**
- Clear product strategy
- Specific problems for teams
- Context & constraints
- NOT solutions

**Step 2: Teams Discover Solutions**
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Experimentation & iteration
- Own the outcome
- Accountable for results

**Step 3: Active Management**
- Leadership coaches teams
- Removes blockers
- Manages portfolio risk
- **Better** management, not less

**No Manager Objectives. No Individual Objectives. Team Objectives Only.**

| **Cadence** | Weekly | Quarterly | Flexible |
| **Grading** | 5/10 confidence | 0.0-1.0 scale | Less emphasis on grading |
| **Individual OKRs** | Skip initially | Skip initially | **Never** |

### The Decision Tree (Including Cagan)

```
START: Want to implement goal-setting framework
│
├─ Do you have empowered product teams?
│  ├─ NO → Feature Teams
│  │   ├─ Can you transition to product teams? YES → Use Cagan's Team Objectives during transition
│  │   └─ Can you transition? NO → Don't use OKRs (use Kanban, Sprint Goals, etc.)
│  │
│  └─ YES → Product Teams
│      ├─ Team size < 50? → Use Wodtke
│      ├─ Team size 50-200? → Use Hybrid
│      └─ Team size 200+? → Use Klau
│
├─ Does leadership provide clear product strategy?
│  ├─ NO → **Fix this first!** (or use Cagan's approach to build it)
│  └─ YES → Proceed with OKRs
│
└─ Are you willing to do Team Objectives only (no manager/individual)?
   ├─ NO → Traditional OKRs will likely fail (Cagan's warning)
   └─ YES → Ready for OKRs or Team Objectives
```

### What All Three Agree On

**Wodtke, Klau, AND Cagan agree:**

1. **Prerequisites Matter**
   - Don't cargo cult it
   - Fix org issues first
   - Strategy must exist

2. **Outcomes Over Outputs**
   - Measure impact, not activity
   - Focus on results
   - Quality gates essential

3. **Team-Level Focus**
   - Skip individual OKRs (at least initially)
   - Cross-functional collaboration
   - Shared objectives

4. **Leadership Must Be Active**
   - Not less management, better management
   - Provide strategy & context
   - Coach and support teams

5. **Empowerment is the Goal**
   - Give teams problems, not solutions
   - Trust teams to discover how
   - Autonomy with accountability

---

### When to Move From Cagan → Wodtke/Klau

**Transition Signals:**

✅ **You're ready for traditional OKRs when:**
- Teams are truly empowered product teams
- Leadership provides clear, consistent strategy
- Cross-functional teams are norm
- No more manager/individual OKR pressure
- Team Objectives have been working for 2-3 quarters

**Transition Path:**
1. Start: Cagan's Team Objectives (simple, empowerment-focused)
2. After 2-3 quarters: Add Wodtke's weekly rhythm
3. After 6-12 months: Add Klau's grading discipline (if scaling)
4. Long-term: Full OKR maturity with institutional memory

**Don't rush it:**
- Empowerment culture takes time
- Building org maturity > having "proper" OKRs
- Team Objectives done well > OKRs done poorly
