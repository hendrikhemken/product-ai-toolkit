# Rick Klau's OKR Approach (Google)

*Quarterly grading, radical transparency, 0.6-0.7 target*

---

## Core Philosophy

> "OKRs impose discipline on the organization."

**Klau's Belief:**
OKRs create **transparency and coordination** across large organizations. They help everyone understand what they're working on AND what they're NOT working on.

**Key Principles:**
- Transparency is non-negotiable
- Measurability above all
- Grading for learning
- Institutional memory
- Coordination at scale

---

## Who This Is For

**Ideal Companies:**
- Enterprises (200+ people)
- Large tech companies
- Organizations needing coordination
- Multiple departments/teams
- Transparency-valued cultures

**NOT For:**
- Very small startups (< 20)
- Teams needing rapid iteration only
- Organizations that can't do transparency

---

## OKR Structure

### Objective (Qualitative)

**Criteria:**
- ✅ Should feel **uncomfortable** at quarter start
- ✅ Qualitative direction
- ✅ Uncertain if achievable
- ✅ If certain → not thinking big enough

**Good Examples:**
- "Accelerate revenue growth" (Blogger)
- "Deliver Google-quality search results" (YouTube)
- "Win the Super Bowl" (49ers GM analogy)

**Test:**
> "If you are certain you will nail it, you're not pushing hard enough. You're not thinking broadly enough. You're not thinking big."

### Key Results (Quantitative)

**Marissa Mayer's Rule (Non-Negotiable):**
> "It's not a key result unless it has a number."

**Characteristics:**
- Must be objectively gradable
- Lead to measurable proof of progress
- Connect to objectives
- Typically 3-5 per objective

**Example (Blogger):**
```
Objective: Accelerate Revenue Growth

Key Results:
- Launch monetized tab
- Increase RPMs by 20% through placement targeting
- Launch 3 revenue experiments to learn drivers
- Finalize PRD for Ad Network + secure eng allocation
```

**Evolution (2022 Update):**
Focus on **outcomes over activity**
- ❌ "Launch 3 experiments" → activity
- ✅ "Learn 3 key revenue drivers from experiments" → outcome

---

## Grading System (CENTRAL TO METHODOLOGY)

### The 0.0 to 1.0 Scale

**Scoring:**
- **0.0** = No progress
- **0.3** = Made some progress
- **0.6-0.7** = **Sweet spot** ✅ (GOOD performance!)
- **0.8-1.0** = Sandbagging (goals too conservative)
- **1.0** = Either too easy OR binary achievement

### Interpretation

**0.0 - 0.4: ❌ Problematic**
- Completely missed
- Need to understand why
- Wrong goals or wrong execution?

**0.6 - 0.7: ✅ SUCCESS**
- **This is the target!**
- You pushed hard
- Ambitious but achievable
- Perfect balance

**0.8 - 1.0: ⚠️ Sandbagging**
- Goals too conservative
- Weren't thinking big enough
- Set bolder goals next time

**Klau's Insight:**
> "Grades don't matter except as directional indicators. Low scores benefit everyone more because they tell you what NOT to do."

### Grading Process

**How to Grade:**
1. Score each KR from 0.0 to 1.0
2. Average the KR scores for overall Objective score
3. Use rubric:
   - Achieved fully = 1.0
   - Achieved mostly = 0.7
   - Achieved halfway = 0.5
   - Minimal progress = 0.3
   - No progress = 0.0

**Google's Method:**
- Simple average of KRs
- "Really sophisticated math" (Klau's sarcasm)
- Tool just averages the numbers

---

## Three-Level OKR Structure

### Football Team Mental Model

```
GM (CEO)
├─ Head Coach (CPO)
│   ├─ Offensive Coordinator (Team A)
│   │   └─ Players (Engineers, Designers)
│   └─ Defensive Coordinator (Team B)
└─ Special Teams Coach (Team C)
```

**Key Insight:**
Not everyone's OKRs appear in Company OKRs, but all support ultimate objective.

### Level 1: Company OKRs

**Who Sets:** CEO, Board, Leadership
**Number:** 3-5 maximum
**Characteristics:**
- Most important things for company
- Visible to everyone
- Cascades down (but not dictated)

**Example (49ers):**
```
GM's Objective: Win the Super Bowl

Key Results:
- Draft quality offensive line
- Sign top-tier defensive back
- Improve red zone efficiency to 60%
```

### Level 2: Team OKRs

**Who Sets:** Team leads (negotiated with leadership)
**Number:** 3-5 per team
**Characteristics:**
- Priorities for team as unit
- NOT just bucket of personal OKRs
- Support company objectives

**Example (Offensive Coordinator):**
```
Objective: Dominate time of possession

Key Results:
- Average 35+ minutes possession per game
- 150+ rushing yards per game
- <5 3-and-outs per game
```

### Level 3: Personal OKRs

**2022 UPDATE: Skip Initially!**

**Klau's Evolution:**
> "Ignore individual OKRs when first implementing the framework. They can be confusing/frustrating and potentially redundant."

**When to Add:**
- After company + team OKRs working
- For growth/development goals
- Optional, not required

**Original Approach (2013):**
- 3-5 objectives per person
- Negotiated with manager
- Connected to team/company goals

---

## Radical Transparency

### Public OKRs (Non-Negotiable at Google)

**How It Works:**
- Everyone can see everyone's OKRs
- CEO to intern
- Linked in employee directory (next to email/phone)
- Current AND historical OKRs visible

**Why This Matters:**

**1. Coordination**
> "Know what others are working on"

**2. Efficiency**
> "Don't pitch conflicting ideas to same exec"

**3. Alignment**
> "See how your work connects to others"

**4. Accountability**
> "Social pressure to deliver (in good way)"

**Klau's Quote:**
> "These [OKRs] cannot be siloed. It is critical for everyone in the organization to know what everyone else is working on. That's true from the CEO on down."

### Company-Wide Meetings

**Quarterly Cadence:**

**Start of Quarter:**
- CEO presents company OKRs
- VPs present department OKRs
- All published internally
- Full transparency

**End of Quarter:**
- Present grades publicly
- Explain WHY that grade
- Share learnings
- Celebrate AND commiserate

**Culture Building:**
- Openness about wins AND failures
- Learning from misses
- No punishment for ambitious fails

---

## Quarterly Cadence

### Start of Quarter

**Week 1:**
1. Company meeting: Leadership presents OKRs
2. Teams finalize their OKRs
3. All OKRs published (public)
4. Alignment conversations

**Klau's Process:**
- OKRs negotiated with manager
- Not dictated top-down
- Some bottom-up input
- Finalized collaboratively

### Mid-Quarter Check-In

**Week 6-7:**
1. One-on-one with manager
2. Reality check: "Am I on track?"
3. Recalibrate if needed
4. Adjust priorities

**Purpose:**
> "At least once or twice in a quarter, there should be a meeting where everyone has gone through the exercise of saying: 'This is what I said I'd be doing. Am I in the ballpark?'"

### End of Quarter

**Week 12-13:**
1. Grade all OKRs (0.0-1.0)
2. Company meeting: Present grades
3. VPs present team grades
4. Explain results
5. Share learnings
6. Set next quarter's OKRs

---

## Red Team Reviews (2022 Innovation)

**Purpose:** Review OKRs adversarially BEFORE finalizing

### The Question:
> "Could we harm the company by achieving these?"

### What to Check:

**1. Gameable Metrics**
- Can you hit the number without impact?
- Example: "Launch 5 features" → Could be junk

**2. Perverse Incentives**
- Could achieving this hurt other areas?
- Missing quality gates?

**3. Short-Term vs Long-Term**
- Short-term win, long-term damage?
- Technical debt ignored?

### How to Fix:

**Add Quality Gates:**
- ❌ "Launch 5 features"
- ✅ "Launch 5 features with NPS 40+ and <2% churn"

**Add Balancing Metrics:**
- Growth KR + Quality KR
- Revenue KR + Customer Satisfaction KR
- Speed KR + Stability KR

---

## Institutional Memory (2022 Innovation)

### DON'T Edit OKRs Mid-Quarter!

**Why This Matters:**

**1. Shows What Was Tried**
> "We tried that in Q2 2024, scored 0.3"

**2. Onboarding Tool**
- New members see history
- Understand why decisions made
- Learn from past attempts

**3. Compounding Knowledge**
- Organization learns over time
- Don't repeat failures
- Build on successes

**4. Honest Assessment**
- Can't revise history
- Real learning from real attempts
- Preserves context

**Klau's Insight:**
> "OKRs become institutional memory. Don't edit them mid-quarter. They show what you tried, what worked, what didn't."

### Exception:

**Only edit if:**
- Catastrophic external event
- Complete strategy pivot
- Existential crisis

Otherwise: **Suck it up, learn from it**

---

## Separation from Performance Reviews

### CRITICAL PRINCIPLE (2022 Emphasis)

**Klau's Strong Warning:**
> "Should be shouted from the rafters: OKRs are COMPLETELY separate from performance evaluations."

**Why This Is Critical:**

**The Tension:**
- OKRs target 60-70% achievement
- Performance reviews want 100% achievement
- → Fundamentally incompatible!

**What Happens If Mixed:**
- ❌ Teams sandbag (safe goals for bonus)
- ❌ No ambition
- ❌ No innovation
- ❌ OKRs become meaningless

**Google's Practice:**
> "At no point were my quarterly OKR bullets factored into my annual evaluation."

**Proper Use in Reviews:**
- ✅ Can include as context in self-review
- ✅ Helpful to recall what you worked on
- ✅ Shows alignment with company goals
- ❌ **NOT** a direct scoring input
- ❌ **NOT** tied to compensation

---

## Tools & Systems

### Google's Internal Tool

**What It Does:**
- Text fields for Objectives & KRs
- Input grades for each KR
- Calculate average (the "sophisticated math")
- Show historical OKRs
- Public to all employees

**Klau's Point:**
> "The tool is NOT the key. It's the commitment to being measurable, transparency, and grading process."

### Recommended Tools (For Others)

**Simple Options:**
- ✅ Google Sites (page per quarter)
- ✅ Wiki (flexible, easy to edit)
- ✅ Google Docs (works but unwieldy)
- ✅ Spreadsheets (good for calculations)
- ✅ Simple Rails app (text + username)

**What Matters More Than Tool:**
1. Commitment to measurability
2. Transparency (everyone sees)
3. Grading process
4. Regular rhythm

**When to Use OKR Software:**
- After process is proven
- When scaling significantly
- Tool fits your workflow
- NOT before understanding methodology

---

## Common Mistakes (Klau's 2022 Updates)

### 1. Not Saying NO Clearly Enough

**Problem:** Treating all priorities as equal

**Klau's Insight:**
> "OKRs help me understand what I'm NOT going to be working on."

**Fix:**
- Explicitly identify what you're NOT doing
- Good ideas become distractions
- OKRs are about focus

### 2. Focusing on Activity Instead of Impact

**Problem:** Key results measure "doing stuff" not outcomes

**Example:**
- ❌ "Launch 3 experiments"
- ✅ "Learn 3 key revenue drivers that inform roadmap"

**Fix:**
- Always ask: "What's the business impact?"
- Metrics connected to goals
- Outcomes > Outputs

### 3. Using OKRs for Performance Reviews

**Problem:** Kills ambition, encourages sandbagging

**Fix:**
- Complete separation
- Make it crystal clear from day one
- Different conversations entirely

### 4. OKRs That Can Be Gamed

**Problem:** Can achieve without business progress

**Fix:**
- Red Team review
- Add quality gates
- Balance competing forces

### 5. Too Many Objectives

**Klau's Worst Quarter:**
- 7 objectives = exhausted
- Recommendation: 3-5 max
- Don't stuff each with 12 key results

### 6. Editing OKRs Mid-Quarter

**Problem:** Erases institutional memory

**Fix:**
- Don't edit (except catastrophic events)
- Learn from what you set
- Use learnings for next quarter

---

## Starting at Small Scale

**Klau's Recommendation:**
> "Even if it feels a little artificial if you're a company of five, the discipline that it brings is immeasurable."

**Start ASAP:**
- Even team of one can use OKRs
- Discipline is valuable at any size
- Scales as you grow

**But Commitment Required:**
- Not a half-hearted effort
- Leadership must engage
- Transparency must be real
- Grading must happen

---

## The 2022 Evolution

### What Klau Updated:

**1. Saying NO**
- More emphasis needed
- OKRs define what you're NOT doing
- Critical for focus

**2. Outcomes Over Outputs**
- Activity-based KRs don't work
- Must measure impact
- Connect to business results

**3. Skip Individual OKRs Initially**
- Start with Company + Team
- Individual OKRs can confuse
- Add later if needed

**4. Performance Review Separation**
- "Should be shouted from rafters"
- More emphasis in 2022 update
- Critical for success

**5. Red Team Reviews**
- New concept (2022)
- Adversarial OKR review
- Prevent gaming

**6. Institutional Memory**
- New emphasis (2022)
- Don't edit mid-quarter
- Learn from history
