### Introduction

Good morning. My name is Rick Klau, I'm a partner at Google Ventures. For those of you I haven't met before, thank you for coming this morning. Thank you to those of you watching online. We're here to talk about objectives and key results. This is one of the critical elements of how Google managed its early execution and really grew the company, and remains a pretty critical element of its DNA today.

I came to Google a little over five years ago. I was part of a company, as some of you know, called FeedBurner. FeedBurner was acquired in June of '07. The very first day that I joined Google was the first day of a quarter, which meant that Google was already about a week and a half, two weeks into that quarter's OKR process. I didn't know what OKRs meant. I was asked to draft my OKRs within my new team. I really didn't have any idea what was expected of me. Certainly at startups prior to Google, I'd never had a formal process of setting my objectives or measuring goals.

But in the last five years, I've set OKRs as a Biz Dev lead, as a product manager on a couple of different products, and then more recently in my time as a partner at Google Ventures. The process had a real clarifying effect for me personally and for the teams that I was a part of. It helped me understand what mattered. Just as importantly, it helped me understand what I wasn't going to be working on.

Today we're going to talk about:
- What are OKRs?
- How do we implement them at Google?
- How to adopt this process at your own company

I think one of the things startups often struggle with, and one of the things I spend a lot of time working with you all on, is fighting the urge to just say "well, that's Google, right? You guys are different. We're not Google." Well, as you'll see in this deck, Google wasn't Google when this was first adopted at Google. Google was under a year old when John Doerr came to Google and pitched Larry, Sergey, Marissa, and others on how to adopt this process at a very young and ambitious company.

I'm going to apologize in advance because I've committed at least two cardinal sins of, in this case, Keynote, not PowerPoint. So much so it wouldn't surprise me if somebody from Cupertino drove over and wrestled control of this remote from me. Not only have I used slides that are almost entirely text, which is bad enough on its own, but in addition I've also embedded an all-text presentation inside of an all-text presentation, which is a new low for me as a presenter. But I think as you'll see, there's a reason for having done that.

### The Book: "In the Plex" by Steven Levy

Quick show of hands - how many have read the book "In the Plex" by Steven Levy? [About 20% of audience]

This really is a great book. Steven was given really incredibly direct access to not only our founders and many early employees, but a number of people across Google that gave Steven a very broad sense of who we are, how we worked.

He talked about how in 1999, John Doerr, who is a partner, some of you may know, at Kleiner Perkins, remains a board member for Google to this day, came to Google to talk about a process that he'd witnessed at Intel called OKRs - Objectives and Key Results.

Steven in his book talks about how Doerr came into Google and OKRs were an immediate hit. Unlike what you might expect, where this might be seen as some kind of liberation of a tech company, instead it was immediately apparent to Googlers that this was data. What this gave the company access to was a way to quantify, instead of just qualifying, what it was they were working on and how well they were doing towards those goals, and periodically reviewing did they meet expectations for what it was that they were trying to do.

A highlighted element here - a couple of things that are critical to how we think about OKRs, and I think you'll see themes resonate throughout this discussion:

**It was essential that OKRs be measurable.** An employee didn't say "I'll make Gmail a success" but "I'll launch Gmail in September and have a million users by November." Real critical - there are two different points, right? In the key result: launch by September and a million users by November. Those are both measurable. The key here is that not only is the objective clear, but the means by which you would grade whether or not you had met that objective is really what's key here.

**Marissa goes on to say: "It's not a key result unless it has a number."**

The OKR embodied ambition. It sanctions the ability to take risks, says Doerr.

**Everyone's OKRs from Larry and Sergey on down are public within the company.** Everyone. It's part of your directory listing. When Moma [internal directory] references it by name here in the book - if you go into Moma, you look up an employee, right next to their cell phone, their email address, their title is a link to their OKRs. That means that not only can you see what they're working on this quarter, but you can see what they were working on last quarter, quarter before. You can see their grades. We'll talk more about the process of how to grade them and why different approaches may be beneficial in your companies.

### John Doerr's Original 1999 Deck

So I got hold of John Doerr's actual deck - this is the embedded all-text presentation I was talking about a few minutes ago. I actually got the original deck from 1999. I think it helps - I'm not including the entire deck. I tried to take what I felt were the most critical elements that illustrated both how we think about them at Google and how I think you should put them into context for understanding how they might apply in your company.

#### Slide: Objective of This Deck

Imagine that I'm John Doerr for a moment, presenting this to Larry, Sergey, Marissa. He started his deck with his OKR for that meeting:

**Objective:** I'm going to develop a workable model for planning

**As measured by:**
1. Finishing the presentation on time (Now I haven't told any of you how long this workshop is going to take, so I think I have a pretty good chance of finishing on time since only I know what "on time" is)
2. Completing a sample set of three months' objectives and key results (So at the end of the meeting they were going to have a set of their OKRs)
3. Having management agree to institute trial system for a 3-month period

Pretty straightforward.

#### The Football Team Example

John goes on to give examples of an OKR in the context of a football team. Now I'm a big 49ers fan, so I'm going to use the 49ers as my illustration. I think the key here is one of the things that when I've talked with many of you individually, you've struggled with: how to connect the individual objectives with the team objectives with the company objectives. I think John's example of the football team actually goes a long way to helping clarify what that looks like.

**General Manager / Team Owner (Jed York):**
- **Objective:** Making money for the owners
- **Key Results:**
  - Win the Super Bowl
  - Fill the stands to 88%

Now 49ers would tell you we're going to have sellouts all season, but these are measurable key results with an objective that in this case is defined as the GM making money for the owners.

**Head Coach:**
Notice that he doesn't care about filling the stands. All he cares about is winning the game - winning the Super Bowl.

- **Objective:** Win the Super Bowl
- **Key Results:**
  - Passing attack: 200+ yards per game
  - Cumulative running: 200+ yards per game
  - Number three in defensive stats

Given the 49ers defense, you might say things like we'll have a net positive takeaway differential where we'll have more interceptions or fumble recoveries than the other team. These are measurable things that at a high level the head coach is focused on.

These roll up into the prior comment which was the GM is going to win the Super Bowl, fill the stands. But obviously there are some things that the GM is not worried about that the head coach is intensely focused on.

**Public Relations:**
Their responsibility - they own filling the stands.

- **Key Results:**
  - Hire two colorful players
  - Get media coverage
  - Highlight key players

Obviously this is a way that you generate enthusiasm amongst your fans. That may be a byproduct of what the coach focuses on, but it is absolutely 100% of what the PR function is focused on here.

**Defensive Coordinator:**
All the defensive coordinator is focused on is obviously the defensive stats.

- **Key Results:**
  - Hold other team under 100 yards passing
  - Intercept at least twice in the game
  - Record at least three sacks

Whatever you want to extend that analogy - whatever might be important given the players that defensive coordinator has at his disposal.

**Offense:**
Of course doesn't care about interceptions except for not throwing them.

- **Key Results:**
  - 75% completion rate

I should note here, for those of you that follow football, 75% completion rate would be pretty astounding, particularly in a Super Bowl. **Part of the goal of an objective is that it be a little uncomfortable.** You don't want to always get - on a grading scale of zero to one - you don't always want to get a one. In fact, **the target ought to be a 0.6 to 0.7.**

You should always have goals that are slightly out of reach, that feel a little uncomfortable, so that you are always striving to do more, to do better than perhaps you did the quarter before or you think is reasonable in the context of the current quarter.

**Special Teams:**
They're not focused on interceptions. They're not focused on how well the quarterback does. They're focused specifically on:
- Running back kicks
- Trying to block the punt
- Trying to block the field goal

They have very specific goals that are completely distinct from the other guys.

**Same with news staff, same with the scouts.** They may not even be on the field. They may be off watching spring practice for a bunch of colleges.

**The idea here, and what John Doerr was trying to reinforce to the Google team at the time, was that if you roll all of the things up from this foundation level, in their objectives and key results are reflected the ultimate company's priorities. But not every single one of them is going to be considered a company priority.**

Is it that the news staff has a key result of three Sunday feature articles, or an interview in ESPN, or something along those lines? That's not going to be a company OKR. That's not going to be the focus of what the 49ers are thinking about. The GM or the owner of the team isn't going to be waking up every day saying "how are we doing on those Sunday features?" But you better believe the head of the news team, the PR team within the 49ers organization, is absolutely thinking only about those things.

What ties that further to the company objective? Well, ties back up into filling the stands. So you can start to see how you can pretty clearly connect these dots, even if not all of the foundation objectives and key results ultimately show up in the company OKRs.

### Why Use Objectives and Key Results?

Now, I want to talk about why you use objectives and key results. This was John trying to convince Google. Google now has lived this approach for 13 years. For those of you that have not yet made the commitment to embracing this method of measuring both your objectives looking forward and grading yourselves looking backwards, let me talk about some of the things that led to John's bullets here where he was trying to make the case.

Let me tell you, as a Googler who's now lived this for five of Google's 13 years using OKRs, what does it do?

**1. It is absolutely amazing for imposing discipline on the organization.**

It helps me individually understand what I'm working on and why. It also helps me make conscious decisions about what I'm not working on, which is often just as important.

**2. Make sure that by making these OKRs public, everyone on my team, anybody in the company that cares can see exactly what I'm working on, can see what my priorities are.**

Why is that helpful? Well, to give you one example: when I get dinged by a team at Google who wants - let's say when I was the PM for YouTube's homepage, somebody pings me and says "hey, we would love to promo this new product on the YouTube homepage."

Well, everyone would love to promo things on the YouTube homepage. The person who's going to make that pitch - it might help them to know what my priorities were for the quarter in which we were working. They can immediately know, even before they talk to me, what my answer is likely to be.

If the thing that they're promoting is somehow connected to the things that I care about for that quarter, they've got a very easy case to make. They're helping me deliver on my objectives.

If, on the other hand, it's a distraction, they at least know going into the conversation they're unlikely to get much traction in that quarter. Now it might help to plant the seed with me, let's say in late October, so that as I start thinking about Q1's OKRs coming up, that I have them on my radar.

**3. By writing objectives and key results, specifically the key results that are inherently measurable, you're establishing how you're going to measure what it is you're working on.**

In the process of drafting those OKRs - and we'll talk about how particularly individuals set their OKRs - you come up with really consensus from the individual to the manager, manager to the team, to the company depending on how big you are. That might be individual to CEO, where everyone understands at a pretty basic level what is it we're trying to do, and more importantly, how to measure whether we're there or not, and how close we are.

**4. Focusing effort.**

I think we'll talk more about that in a little bit.

### The Virtuous Cycle

There's a thing I really like about how this process ends up getting embraced - there's a really virtuous cycle that happens.

**Company objectives** are generally set by the CEO, your board, the leadership team, who should have a pretty strong sense in any given quarter of what the things are that matter most to the company.

Take my FeedBurner example back in the day. Dick Costolo was our CEO. He had a somewhat comical way of establishing it, but the mission was: **Get all the feeds.** If we get all the feeds syndicating all these RSS feeds through the FeedBurner platform where we could both measure all the traffic that was happening and give publishers a way to monetize that traffic, it was a very clear statement of what it was we were trying to do.

That meant that when I would go off to New York and come back and say "well, such and such company wants us to do X," the question that always followed was: **Does that get us closer to getting all the feeds?**

And if it was a distraction - might be an interesting revenue opportunity - but it was not delivering on the main core focus of what it was we were trying to achieve, then the answer was no.

These corporate objectives are set and generally communicated down throughout the organization.

**Individual objectives,** by contrast, are often what the individual wants to work on and what the manager wants that person working on. Instead of this being an all top-down discussion, it often ends up being a bit of a cycle.

We know generally what the company wants to be accomplishing. As an individual, I want to work on important things. So I'm going to find the things that are within my sphere that I can do that are most beneficial to the company, and I'll come up with a list. Then I'll communicate that to my manager or the CEO or whomever it is I report to, and we can have a bit of a give and take.

Now what's interesting in this process is that occasionally things that individuals want to be working on might end up opening up new discussions for what the company should be doing.

Good example of that at Google: an engineer named Paul Buchheit was really annoyed with the state of mail clients in Linux. So he started - he thought maybe I could make mail searchable as sort of the core interface - and he started what became Gmail. Well, over time, Gmail became its own practice group at Google effectively and became one of the core strategic goals at Google, which then had a way of creating its own objectives and key results for the people who were working on Gmail.

### Communication Process

Let's talk about the communication:

**One-on-one meetings** - where as an individual contributor I talk to my manager, my boss, the CEO, whomever it is about what it is I want to be working on and what I think is the best use of my time. The one-on-ones at the end of the quarter and the very beginning of the quarter are best. John talks here about negotiating what those key results might be. That's actually a pretty good term for it, because you are ultimately offering what it is I want to work on, and what I'm hearing back is what we want you to be working on. Somewhere in the middle we find the best combination of the two.

**At a company-wide meeting,** the company OKRs are communicated and the team owners identify what it is they're going to be working on. There's also a grading process that happens here that we'll talk about in a little bit.

### Typical Cycle Timeline

[Rick shows a timeline slide]

I'm not going to dwell on this timeline only because I drafted one specifically for the time frame we're in, about the end of October, that I think will help clarify what the general rhythm of when you should be thinking about which steps in the process. We'll come back to that.

### Basic Hygiene

Some basic hygiene:

**You don't want to have 12 objectives.** It's too much for any one person to be working on. Really, if you think about a quarter being effectively 12 weeks, if you had in total only a week to give to any given objective, it's unlikely that you could move the needle much on any of them. So you really want to limit the number of objectives you have and you want to make sure that you're very clear about what the key results from that objective are.

**Don't, in the interest of limiting your objectives, stuff every objective with 12 key results.** You want to be very clear.

**Fine to be ambitious,** but I'll tell you personally there was one quarter when I had seven objectives. I have never been more exhausted and just mentally drained from the amount of intellectual juggling it took to keep all of those different objectives sort of clear in my head and keeping track on where I was with each and who I was relying on and what I needed to coordinate. It was just too much, and it ultimately took its toll. It was clear at the end of that quarter that I had been stretched a little too thin.

**60% of the objectives ought to come from the bottom up.** John here has a number. I don't know that the number here matters as much as the overall intent, which is: more than half of the company's objectives need to be coming from the individuals up through the organization. If there is too much top-down dictation, it's going to be hard to inspire a lot of those people to be working on things because they're going to be told what to do instead of telling you what they think is the best use of their time and talent.

**Everybody must mutually agree - no dictating.** I think that's really just another way of saying what I said a minute ago.

**One page best.** We do all of this electronically now, so there's no issue of page length.

**Here's a really important point: OKRs are not a performance evaluation tool.**

What that means is in the annual performance review cycle that Google goes through, OKRs are not a standard element of that evaluation.

Let me be clear: when I was reviewed each of the last five years, when I would sit down and write up my summary of what I did in the year prior, what I think that means for the company, whether I wanted to go up for promotion or not - at no point in time were my quarterly OKR bullets factored in into that evaluation.

Now it's always possible to just include your OKRs as part of that packet. I found individually they were always tremendously useful because it gave me really at a summary glance what I'd been up to over the last year. I could look at the last four quarters of OKRs. I could look at the grades - again, we'll talk about the grading process in a little bit - and I knew really within a few minutes what were the biggest things I'd worked on, what were the most dramatic results as a byproduct of that work, and I could then summarize my contribution to the company, my impact, in a way that previously when I thought about prior startups prior to coming to Google was much harder to recall back. What did I do 6, 9, 12 months ago?

**Your target should be a 0.6 to 0.7 on a 0.0 to 1.0 scale.**

If you consistently get ones, you're not crushing it - you're sandbagging.

Anything below 0.4 is definitely in the red. That means you missed the key result entirely, and that should be a forcing function for reevaluating whether or not that is an objective you want to continue to work on.

### Last Slide of Embedded Deck

[Last slide of John Doerr's deck]

John here talks about how this has an alignment function, and that it ensures everybody in the organization's working towards the same set of results. I agree with that. That was certainly my experience at Google. It was very easy to see amongst my team members where we were working on complementary things, where we were working on dependent things, where there was something I was doing that I needed three other people to deliver something. So by keeping track of where they were in their progress helped me understand how likely I was to deliver on my OKRs.

It fairly organically ensures the organization's tuned in to what everybody is up to. That virtuous cycle I talked about a few slides ago - there's a wonderful - I used the word "organic" a minute ago, it's the best I can think of here - that just ensures that you're working on things that support what the company is focused on, as do the people sitting next to you and across from you and down the hall. There is a confidence and, candidly, a comfort that comes from knowing that you're not treading water. You're not walking through molasses. You know that everyone shares those commitments.

Bizarrely, John even says here on the last bullet that **OKRs are fun.** I think that is open to some interpretation, but I do think that there are elements of how to make this part of the team process that I'll talk about in a little bit.

### Keys to Good OKRs

Okay, keys to good OKRs, just in terms of rhythm and process:

**OKRs are both quarterly and annually set.** Annual OKRs are not written in stone. If you set them in December and in May you've assessed and you say "things that we thought were true in November/December just aren't proving to be true," don't obviously feel beholden to see them out. Revise them. They are directional aids, not blinders.

**As I've said and I'll continue to say, I think this is one of the critical elements of OKRs: they are measurable.** The fact that I know whether or not we shipped in September like I said we would - well, that's measurable. If we shipped in September, great, give it a one if in fact that was the entirety of the key result.

**Important to note here that there are OKRs for each individual, there are OKRs at the team level** that summarize what the collection of people are working on, **and then there are OKRs up at the company level** which tend to reflect the most important three, four, no more than five things that the company cares about.

**Of course, OKRs are publicly available to the entire company.** These cannot be siloed. It is critical for everyone in the organization to know what everyone else is working on. That's true from the CEO on down.

**Grading is also fundamental to this exercise.**

### Differentiating Objective vs Key Results

Before diving into my personal OKRs from my days when I was a PM on Blogger, I've got two more comments here. Two more slides I want to talk about: differentiating between the objective and the key results, and then talk a little bit about differentiating personal versus team versus company objectives.

**Objectives should feel uncomfortable going into a quarter.** You should be uncertain as to whether or not you can deliver on the thing that you've just said you will deliver. If you are certain you will nail it, you're not pushing hard enough. You're not thinking broadly enough. You're not thinking big.

**The key results are the things that will ensure that you deliver on the objective. They have to be quantifiable. They have to lead to you being able to objectively grade them.**

Don't set an OKR that says "I will make Gmail better," because in your opinion you've made it better because you made it prettier. But if that degrades usage, if it leads to user attrition, if it means people send fewer messages per minute, hour, whatever the metric is, then you have not made Gmail better and it's impossible to objectively assess that.

Don't say "make it better." Say that you'll be able to help users respond to messages more quickly. Well, that's easy - you can measure that. And in fact, the better way to say that is: "I will reduce the average time to response sent from whatever it is now by 30%."

### Personal vs Team vs Company OKRs

**Personal OKRs** are pretty straightforward: What are you working on? What is most important to you? What are the things that at the end of the quarter you'll be able to show you did?

**Team OKRs** are the priorities for the team, not just the bucket of all of the personal OKRs. Think about our example from John Doerr's slides of the 49ers. Personal OKRs - that's Alex Smith, Frank Gore, David Akers, Vernon Davis, Crabtree, Moss, you name it. Each individual player has their own OKRs, and obviously those are going to be quite a bit different.

The team OKRs: offensive coordinator, defensive coordinator, PR, head of ticket sales, the new stadium person who's coordinating season tickets - those are the team OKRs.

**Company OKRs:** Big picture, top level focus. Win the Super Bowl. Might have a few others there. Secure home field advantage through the playoffs might be another company-level OKR. Things that help clarify for each individual what the most critical things are to the organization as a whole.

### Rick's Personal OKRs from Blogger Days

All right, as I said, we're going to look at a couple of my OKRs from my Blogger days. Some helpful context before we dive into this:

At the time that I took on Blogger, Blogger was the eighth largest web property in the world. Still incidentally in the top 10 worldwide. So that's a good trivia question next time you're at a bar and somebody asks "what is Google's third largest web property by page view traffic?" Not by visitors anymore. First is obviously Google. Second obviously YouTube. Almost no one knows that Blogger is the third. I take a little bit of pride in this as you can tell.

But again, for context: Blogger was a fairly ignored product internally, fairly forgotten, at least within the US tech echo chamber, even though it remained this amazing huge engine of traffic worldwide.

It was the middle of the recession. Google was looking at different products that it owned and trying to figure out whether any of them were revenue generating or could be revenue generating. Blogger was making a little bit of money at the time but not a lot. So I was asked to come in and turn Blogger into more of a business.

In these personal OKRs that I'm going to share, I've removed some of the specific details because for illustrative purposes they're not relevant and I don't want to put you in possession of any material information about some of our products.

#### Objective 1: Accelerate Revenue Growth

My first objective was always: **Accelerate revenue growth.** Every quarter that I managed Blogger, my first objective, the thing that I needed to think about every week that I was running that product: **Make more money.**

**Key Results:**

**1. Launch a monetized tab** (so this was the first quarter that I was on Blogger)

At the time it was - I'd counted - 14 clicks for any Blogger owner who wanted to put AdSense on their site, which is ridiculous. Google owned Blogger. Google owned AdSense. I wanted to launch a monetized tab that would make that a one-click operation.

So first key result: launch a tab. And by the way, I had other key results as part of this that quantified the number of publishers that we would bring into AdSense as a result of this.

**2. Implement AdSense host channel placement targeting to increase RPMs by XX%**

Note here: this key result is written in a way that the core goal is increasing RPM by a set percentage. If I had implemented and launched this host channel placement targeting, which was just a way of bundling a bunch of similarly themed blogs into a targetable channel for advertisers, if I had launched that and had no impact on increasing revenue on those blogs, then I'd get a zero, or maybe a 0.2 on this key result. The key for nailing this key result is ensuring that it had measurable uplift impact on revenues.

**3. Launch three revenue-specific experiments to learn what drives revenue growth**

In late '08, early '09, there was a lot we didn't know about making money on Blogger. So Joe Kraus, who hired me to run Blogger (he's who brought me over to Google Ventures), his thing was: don't assume you have the answers. Do lots of experiments. Get into a normal rhythm of launching something to test whether it has an impact. If it does, great, do more of that. If it doesn't, well, file that away, know that it doesn't have an impact, and don't do more like that.

**4. Finalize the PRD [Product Requirements Doc] for the Blogger Ad Network. Secure allocation to build it out the following quarter.**

This is again a measurable OKR, or key result rather, in that it showed preparation work that I'd be doing in this case in Q4 so that something would get launched in Q1.

Now if I wrote the PRD entirely under my own control - whether I did or I didn't - but failed to ensure that the engineers would be on the hook for building it out in Q1, at best I might get a 0.5 on this OKR. I would argue that far more important to get the engineering allocation than it is to just write the PRD. So again, in grading this, that'll come into play when we look at grading these, and I will be grading them in just a sec.

#### Objective 2: Grow Blogger Traffic by X% Over Our Organic Growth

Next objective is to **grow Blogger traffic by a certain percentage over our organic growth.**

Now Blogger was this wonderful gift in that it had hundreds of millions of visitors every month and would continue to have hundreds of millions of visitors a month whether I got out of bed or not. They would continue to read blog posts. They would continue to visit through search. It was just this engine. At that point it was turning 10 years old that year. It was inevitable that it would continue to get traffic and that as the internet continued to grow and more people came online, almost certain that traffic would go up over what it had been the year before.

So my objective here was to not sandbag and say "hey, grow traffic," but to ensure that I was the one moving the lever up. So the key here is: **growing traffic over and above what it would do normally.**

**Key Results:**

**1. Launch three features that will have a measurable impact on Blogger traffic**

**2. Improve our 404 handling**

Very tactical, but if you think about a site that gets hundreds of millions of visitors, not all of them land on pages that still exist. People delete posts. Blogs go away. If we had wanted to create a worse 404 experience for users, I don't think it would have been possible at the time.

We were - blogs had their own style, had their own themes. We were serving an error page that was not using the default style. So if you were familiar with a blog but landed on a 404, it looked like a system error page, not an error page served up by that blog. We weren't giving you access to archives on that blog. We weren't giving you a search box. We weren't even telling you that this belonged to a blog. It wasn't even a link to the blog on which the 404 was being served.

So we had looked at our logs and we realized: good Lord, we're dumb as a box of rocks. That's a key area where we could dramatically improve the user experience and probably increase our traffic while we're at it.

#### Objective 3: Improving Blogger Reputation

**Improving Blogger reputation** was another objective I had. Again, Blogger was about to turn 10 years old that year. Largely forgotten in the US, even though it continued to have a lot of use. We had not been proactive in communicating with press, with users, with partners. I saw part of my job as reestablishing Blogger as a member of the community, that we were committed to being engaged.

So that meant going out and speaking at events, getting Blogger back out in front of people who pay attention to these things.

**Key Results:**

**1. Speak at three industry events** (measurable key result)

**2. Coordinate Blogger's 10th birthday PR efforts**

Figured out that Blogger would turn 10 in August of that year, so it was important to say "all right, what are we going to do to draw attention to the fact that Blogger has reached this milestone, and how can we use that to further our other objectives?" - increasing traffic, increasing revenue.

So some of the partnerships that I launched in conjunction with this 10th birthday were done specifically to drive revenue. Others were done specifically to drive traffic. We partnered with a company that had built an iPhone app so that our mobile usage would grow. Each of these ultimately served a couple of different objectives.

**3. I pulled a list of the top N users as measured by traffic and personally sent each of them an email**

Many of them had been on the platform for years and had never heard from anybody on our team. I felt like it was critical that - in some cases we were making considerable money, as they were. That was one of the really great things about working on that product. Any amount of money I made, they were making more, because Google would get a percentage of whatever ads were running on their site if they were using AdSense, and they would get the majority.

But I gave them my email address, my cell phone number, my Twitter account, so that they knew how to get in touch if they needed help. They no longer felt like they were using this nameless, faceless product anymore.

**4. Fix the DMCA process**

Very tactical issue. For those that understand US law, the DMCA: as a host of content we are legally obligated to take content down if it is alleged to be infringing the rights of another. Well, a lot of music blogs on Blogger - the RIAA and its international counterpart are fans of sending DMCA notices. The DMCA process, if you were a Blogger user, was pretty broken. I felt this was hurting our reputation with some of our core constituents. Not to mention it was just a degraded user experience overall, whether you were the blogger, whether you were the reader who wanted to read the post.

So I had as a key result fixing this process and eliminating mistaken takedowns of entire blogs when the goal was just to take down a post.

**5. Get us active on Twitter**

That was where a lot of our core demographic were actively chatting with their readers, with each other, with the world. If Blogger had a problem, they would often rant on Twitter about us, sort of into a void. So I wanted to get us active on Twitter as Blogger. It's convenient when the founders of Blogger are the founders of Twitter - they can help get you started on that path.

### Grading Rick's OKRs

Let's look at the grades.

#### Objective 1 Grades: Accelerate Revenue Growth

As I said, accelerating revenue growth was always a key for me. These grades are written to be measurable.

**1. Launching the monetized tab:** We did. We launched. It was a fairly significant change to the overall UI. So that got a **1.0**.

Here, as I said earlier, the goal is a 0.6 or a 0.7, but if there's a very tangible binary key result, you don't give yourself a 0.7 because you never get a 1.0. In this case I did what I said we were going to do. It was considered critical. So you get a one.

**2. Implement AdSense host channel placement targeting to increase RPMs by X%:** We implemented a version of this and it didn't have much of an impact on RPMs. So this one was a fail. **[Low score]**

**3. Launched three revenue-specific experiments:** We launched three experiments. Only two of them really told us anything about driving revenue growth. That was largely because the third experiment that we launched that quarter that we thought would tell us something interesting about revenue really in the end didn't. So that was as much my error in not crafting the experiment more effectively. **[Partial score]**

**4. The PRD for the ad network:** Wrote the PRD. Was still at the end of this quarter doing some horse-trading with my engineering manager on which engineers would be building it out, but we were fairly agreed at the point at which we were grading these that it would get built. There was still a few open questions, so I didn't consider this a one, but overall it was a **0.8**.

**Overall Objective 1 Grade: 0.7**

Now quick note on scoring: you'll note that the 0.7 in white at the top here next to the objective is just an average of the four key results below.

I've seen some get really cute in how they grade their OKRs by trying to determine by weight each of the key results and say "oh well, that's twice as important as this other one, so I'm going to give it a..." or "of the objectives, this is the most important objective, so that's 50/50..."

It's ridiculous. The goal of this is to provide feedback not only to the individual who owns the OKR but to the group and the company ultimately. It is far less critical to get these down to the second, third, fourth decimal point.

I always felt, continue to feel: **grades don't matter except as directional indicators of how you're doing.** If you're spending more than a few minutes at the end of a quarter summarizing your grades, you're doing something wrong. The work should go into doing - delivering on the OKRs - not grading them.

#### Objective 2 Grades: Growing Traffic

On growing traffic, we said we'd launch three features that have a measurable impact on Blogger traffic. We launched two, each of which had a measurable impact. So that's good, but we said we were going to do three. And candidly, to be totally honest, we probably should have been able to do four or five. So this could have been quite a bit better.

On improving Blogger's 404 handling: by the end of this quarter in which this one was graded, we had not proceeded past the mock stage. Was pretty sure we knew how we were going to do it. I just hadn't prioritized getting engineers to build it out. So that was a big miss.

#### Objective 3 Grades: Improving Blogger's Reputation

On improving Blogger's reputation, not least of which because so much of this was solely on my shoulders, this was a much easier one to deliver on.

### More About Grading

Let's talk a little bit more about grading. As I alluded to on the prior slide: **Simplicity is key.** Grade each key result, average them up to give yourself an objective grade, and then average your objective grades to give yourself an overall grade for the quarter if you like.

I don't ultimately think that much matters, but it is helpful to get a sense of where you are. I think in my best quarter I hit a point - it was north of 0.7. I don't think I ever had 0.8 averaged across all of my objectives. Pretty sure that's right. I think it might have been a 0.78 somewhere thereabouts. That was a phenomenal quarter and the grade reflected that.

I had a bunch of quarters between a 0.6 and 0.7, not because it was overly engineered to get there. That just was - I was in the sweet spot of I was delivering on more than I was missing, but there was still a lot of room for improvement.

There were probably two or three quarters where I was below a 0.6, where I was absolutely not delivering to a standard I felt was good.

**High scores (0.8 to 1.0) are possible.** High scores are unlikely. When it happens, it's exceptional. Be proud of the accomplishment. Be absolutely eager to share with your colleagues, your manager, your team, what have you.

But I think the converse is probably more important to focus on, which is **the low scores: 0.4 and below.**

**It's not failure.** One of the reasons when Steven Levy talked about how this became so embraced so early at Google was that this was data. The 0.4, the 0.3, the 0.2, the zero - it's not a failure.

**It's: figure out what to stop doing. Or what did you learn? What did you not know when you said you would do that thing that prevented you from delivering it?**

Do you have any control over removing that obstacle in the quarter ahead, or is it immovable? If it's immovable, go around it. Figure out: either don't focus on that objective anymore, or figure out different ways of achieving it.

**The scores ultimately benefit everyone in the process more by what they help you know what not to do, what to change, what to continue to do more of.** That is ultimately where they're most helpful.

### Company-Wide Scoring Process

Company-wide scoring reinforces the commitment here. Your commitment individually, your commitment as a CEO to repeatedly grade at the company level, at the individual level, helps everyone understand that this really does matter. Once you get into that rhythm, it's just a byproduct of doing your job. It doesn't take a ton of time, but over the quarters and years they become extremely useful.

**The company-wide process:** You're not - unless the company is only four or five people - you're not going to be grading everyone's OKRs in front of the entire company. That's just impractical.

But it is practical that at least once every quarter, sometime after the beginning of the next quarter, that the company's going to get together and they're going to discuss how they did. The owners of those individual OKRs - sorry, of the team OKRs - so in a larger company that's the SVP. In a small growing company it might be you've got the head of product, the head of engineering, and head of marketing maybe, or sales - are each going to get up and say:

"Okay, this was the product OKR for last quarter. Here's how we did. We got a 0.6. Here's why we got a 0.6."

**It's important to explain to everyone in the company why you got the grade you did and what you're going to do differently in the quarter ahead.**

This calibration ends up being extremely useful for keeping everybody honest, ensuring the company is as transparent as it can be, but then also saying "okay, what did we learn?" For me, that was always the most important part.

And then at this company meeting, the last part is **setting the upcoming quarter's OKRs.** Now often there's continuity from the prior quarter to the next quarter. Sometimes it's: we put that project to bed, we either finished it, shipped it, and it's done, or we learned that that's not what we want to be focused on moving forward. Now we're shifting our attention to this other thing.

### How to Implement

Let's talk about how to implement for a moment.

At Google, we eventually built our own system. It's not a complex system. It's a bunch of text fields with text boxes next to the text fields where you can enter in your grades. Then the most sophisticated that it gets is there's a button you can push that says "average my scores" and it does an immediate roll-up of your key results and gives that objective a score. If you want to get even fancier, then you can average your objective scores to get your overall score for the quarter.

That's not something we make available to the public, so that's obviously not a tool you have at your disposal. But it occurs to me that I think some relatively low-tech options are just as valuable:

**Google Sites:** You can create a page, a site's page for the quarter, and each person can add themselves to that page where their name becomes their quarter's objectives and key results - just a bulleted list, very simple. At the end of the quarter they can go back, they can edit their page, and they can add their grades next to it. Pretty low-tech.

**A Wiki** might be slightly more flexible.

**Google Docs or Google Spreadsheets** - I think that starts to get a little unwieldy, particularly as the company grows. But it is potentially a way in which you could do it. The one benefit of using something like Google Spreadsheets of course is that if you've got a lot of people, the ability to do calculations across all of them to get sort of directional indications of by team, by department, what have you, might be really useful.

At least as important as the tool you use is **the communication you do about the commitment itself.**

What I mean by that is: **this needs to not be a half-hearted effort.** It needs to be clear to everyone in the company that for at least a three-month trial period, ideally longer, that everyone in the company is behind this idea.

At Google it was always clear, not only because you could see Larry and Sergey's OKRs, it was always clear that from senior management all the way down, OKRs mattered.

### The Jonathan Rosenberg Email

When I was in the product team, I can't tell you how much of an impact this next email had. I can tell you that when I was putting these slides together over the last week or so, I knew when I got to this point in the presentation I was going to have a screenshot of this email. Because over two years later, I still remembered the email.

The email is one from Jonathan Rosenberg, who used to be the head of product at Google, still very close to Google and advises a bunch of folks in the company on a number of different things. But every quarter he would send out a version of this email. This was the one - it was particularly bad, which is why I remembered it.

But the email that he would send out every quarter within the first few weeks was a **public shaming** of whoever on his team had not updated their OKRs for the quarter.

This particular quarter he didn't send it out until the beginning of November, so it was already about five weeks into the quarter. I'll just read to you a little bit:

> "Our performance on OKRs this quarter was poor. As of today, 9 PMs have still not posted their Q4 OKRs - out of several hundred. That's a full month into the new quarter. The offenders are listed below."

[List of names]

Right below you can see - he has publicly shamed my colleagues. Two friends of mine are on this list as not having taken the time to tell the company what it was they were working on.

He goes on to say:

> "I don't understand why it's so hard for so many of you to take just a few minutes and list your priorities for the quarter."

Last paragraph:

> "For now I recommend we all torture the offenders below by asking them in the halls why the heck they're late on their OKRs. For those of you who find the previous statement offensive, I'll be happy for you to chastise me, as long as your OKRs are posted and current."

**The key here is when you're on a team and you receive an email like this, from the person ultimately responsible for your [team] - this could easily have come from the CEO, this could have easily come from, if you're an engineer, the head of engineering - I know this matters.**

**As an individual, I never wanted to be on that list.** I never wanted the person who was responsible for my team to identify me as holding the rest of the group back. Pretty powerful and simple.

### Timeline for Implementation

So here's a timeline. We're coming into the beginning of November. A couple of thoughts on things that are really critical I think in the next month.

I think there are **two things that matter most for a company thinking about embracing OKRs for a three-month trial:**

**1. You got to be thinking about what your Q1 objectives are going to be.** You probably also want to be thinking about annual OKRs, but tactically thinking about what are the immediate things that we're going to be worried about. If I'm the CEO, I'm thinking just about what are the three or four most important things for 2013.

**2. The other thing that's really critical to be working on right now is deciding how you are going to capture what the OKRs are and how they're going to be shareable inside the company.**

This process will fail unless everyone in the company has a way to see what everybody else is working on.

So I think it's critical over the next four or five weeks that you figure out: whether you're going to use a Wiki, whether you're going to use Google Sites, whether some engineer is going to build a really simple Rails app that's just going to have a bunch of text fields and connect to their username. Keep it simple. Don't over-engineer it initially. It's always easy to migrate to something more powerful down the road. I think the key here is just: know what it's going to be so that if there's any kinks to work out, you get them well worked out well ahead of the end of the year.

**Now into December:** I think the company-wide objectives have got to be communicated for Q1 and for the year. That way everyone else in the company - you also by the way have to communicate what the hell OKRs are, so that there's a general understanding within the company. And by the way, this video is being recorded, is available for anyone in your company to watch. So if anybody has questions about what it is, you could just as easily share this video with them.

Communicate annual and quarterly Q1 objectives for the company.

**Now it's up to the individuals in the company at the end of December, by the very beginning of January, to have their personal OKRs drafted.** That should be at least one draft with a meeting with the manager and at least an iteration to get to consensus. This is that negotiation that John Doerr was talking about.

**Company-wide meeting, probably no later than about the second week of January,** where the company-wide objectives are presented, and if appropriate depending on the size of your team, the team objectives within that company are presented.

**Now throughout the rest of Q1:** Important that there's individual meetings happening between individual contributors and their manager at least once in a quarter. It doesn't need to be overdone. Doesn't need to be weekly check-ins, but at least once or twice, so that there's a general point in the process where everyone in the company has gone through that exercise of saying: "This is what I said at the beginning of the quarter I would be doing. By February 15th, am I in the ballpark?"

If I am, fantastic. Keep doing what I'm doing.

If I'm not, I need to now recalibrate. Do I need to stop doing certain things so that I can deliver on the objectives I set? Or where am I going to miss, and what can I stop focusing on entirely so that I can at least deliver on a few that are really important?

**And then finally you repeat this whole process** so that towards the end of March, now it's up to each individual to start thinking about grading their OKRs. Team owners start coming up with the team scores/grades. And then the CEO/leadership team are going to grade the company's OKRs.

**In the beginning of April, there's going to be a company-wide meeting where you grade Q1's OKRs, explain why you missed or hit and what you've learned about what's going to happen in Q2.** And this just - this process then just happens on a rolling quarterly basis.

### Q&A Session

All right, believe it or not, we are at the end of my formal presentation here. So I am going to pull the Q&A that have come in from you all online and in the room. Thank you for that.

#### Q: What kind of tools do you use for managing and communicating OKRs?

Luke asked: "What kind of tools do you use for managing and communicating OKRs?"

Well, we talked a little bit about that. I've seen it go through at least three revs at Google. Today we have a very simple tool that is really no more than: I log in with my username and I click on the quarter and I add - type in an objective. And then under each objective I have a button to add a key result, and I add each individual key result.

I'd show it to you, but again, it's internal and it's proprietary, so it's not the sort of thing that we would share in a workshop here. But you get the idea of what it is - very, very simple.

At the end of the quarter I go in and I click the "score" button, and that's when I am now just assigning a number in the text box next to each key result. And as I mentioned earlier, then I have the ability to average them. Really sophisticated math going on there.

I think in most of the cases for folks that are here, for folks that are watching online, I think something as simple as a Wiki, if you use a Wiki internally. I think Google Sites would probably be enough.

I think this is the sort of thing you could over-engineer pretty quickly. **The keys are not, in my opinion, the tool. It's the commitment to being measurable, the transparency that everything is available internally to everyone in the company, and the grading process itself.** I think beyond that the tool matters less.

#### Q: What's the cadence for the planning portion of an OKR period?

"For example, is it all one week or spread over multiple? How many meetings do you have with whom in attendance? For reference, at Puppet Labs has one exec retrospective meeting, then an exec planning meeting, then team meetings and exec review meeting, all in one week."

I think each company will likely be a little bit different. In my own assessment, if I were implementing this at my own company tomorrow, I want this to be a relatively lightweight process.

I don't think it necessarily needs to be in a meeting. I think this can be the sort of collaborative drafting that can happen where everyone can take a look at a doc, make some suggested changes, then have a meeting to wrestle over or negotiate over key points so that there can be some consensus.

I think you run the risk of meeting over-meeting the process, which I think could be problematic because then that's reinforcing the wrong thing. **The point here is to be doing the work, not meeting about doing the work.**

So what would I say there? I think in terms of grading, I think it's important that people have that mid-quarter check-in so they have a sense of where they're at. I think there's probably some diligence, maybe an hour towards the end of the quarter, and then a final meeting at the very beginning of the following quarter to come up with a grade.

In terms of planning for the quarter ahead, I think often that's a natural byproduct of the grading process where I think about: What did I get done last quarter? Are there things that are rolling from the last quarter into the next, in which case that's a copy-and-paste operation? Are there things that I wanted to be working on that I deliberately chose not to do in prior quarters for prioritization purposes? Add them in.

I think cramming it all into one week is probably a little too tight. I would say at least bound it from a week before the end of the quarter to a week after the end of the quarter, maybe a little bit of a buffer on either side. I think that'll ultimately give you enough room to give people the feeling that it's aiding in the planning process, not removing time from their schedule.

#### Q: How do you ensure OKRs roll up or decompose down the org structure?

Jeff asked: "How do you ensure OKRs roll up or decompose down the org structure?" Trickle down might be better. Decompose suggests that they go away, but I think I know what Jeff meant there.

So how do we do this? I talked in the deck about the sort of virtuous cycle, and I really do not just believe it - I've seen it work.

The way we ensure is: it used to be Eric [Schmidt] when I first joined Google. Now Larry [Page] is the CEO. There is a quarterly meeting and it is given by Larry, and Larry says: "These are the most important things the company is working on. These are the grades for what we did last quarter. And now I'm going to have Vic and Susan and Jeff and each individual group head get up and explain how they did last quarter and what they're working on next quarter."

Now that has a really important clarifying point. I think most people, particularly in startups, want to be working on the most important things.

It was always very helpful for me as I was going through the process of drafting my OKRs that I would draft them at least in draft form, and then I would attend the company OKR meeting. I would do a reality check against the company OKRs and would want to know: **Can I see in my OKRs the company OKRs? Is what I'm focused on reflected in what the company is most focused on?**

Think about the punter, the quarterback, the running back - is what they're focused on reflected in the GM or the team owner?

I can tell you, at one extreme, there was one quarter when I was running the homepage at YouTube that I owned two of the company's five or six OKRs. That was terrifying, because my OKRs weren't just reflected in the company - they were the company OKRs. That's exciting, but it's also, for a company of at the time about 30,000 employees, a little scary when you're running the team that is responsible for a significant proportion of what the company deems to be most important at the time.

The reason that was a helpful process was: **if I couldn't see the company OKRs in my individual OKRs, then that's when you take the red pen to your personal OKRs and revise.**

#### Q: Cadence for checking progress against OKRs?

Jeff asked: "Cadence for checking process progress against OKRs?"

Different teams will do it differently. You might - it might be more natural to do it every few weeks, particularly in larger teams. I think it's probably realistic that each individual is going to have to own the discipline of managing themselves and maybe having only one or two check-ins in a quarter with their manager specifically against OKRs.

#### Q: Were you using OKRs as Blogger before you joined Google?

So I was asked: was I using OKRs as a Blogger before I joined Google?

To clarify: I joined Google in '07. Google acquired Blogger in '03. I was not obviously part of the Blogger team until late '08. By that point, Blogger was five, six years under Google's ownership and had really embraced OKRs. So sorry if I didn't make that clear.

#### Q: At what point in a company's evolution should the management team institute OKRs?

"At what point in a company's evolution should the management team institute OKRs? Is it five people, 10 people, 15, more?"

**Easy answer: as soon as possible.**

The sooner this is part of the DNA of the company, the sooner this is accepted as part of the normal rhythm that the company gets in, the better off you'll be.

There is always a point at which you can do this. Obviously I'm hosting this workshop because I believe every one of you should have some version of this approach in place at your companies.

So even if you've been around a year or two, it's not too late. But the longer you wait, the longer you're going to have habits form within the company about how things are done, and the more inertia you're going to have to overcome.

**So even if it feels a little artificial if you're a company of five, the discipline that it brings is immeasurable.**

I committed to doing OKRs even though at the Startup Lab right now I'm a team of one. Now technically I'm part of Google Ventures - we're a large and growing team - and I have a manager who I check in with periodically on progress.

But for me, the discipline of looking ahead and saying "these are the things I'm going to focus on this quarter, these are the things I'm not," and then evaluating "how am I doing?" - it's hard for me to imagine doing my job without this discipline.

At the end of the quarter, it makes it unbelievably easy to summarize what we've done and whether we did well or not. And I say "we" - I mean me for the Startup Lab.

So: How many workshops did we schedule this quarter? One of my objectives was launching the video archives, which we launched in the second week. It had been an objective in Q3. I'd done most of the heavy lifting in Q3, couldn't get the trigger pulled on getting the archives up, so it slipped into Q4. My grade for Q3 wasn't as good. My grade for Q4 was less about launching, because I knew that was going to happen in a week or two after the start of the quarter. It was more important to focus on: okay, now we're going to measure how much traffic are the archives getting? How many playbacks are there? How many people have asked for access to the archives?

That's the sort of thing that starts to give you a sense of how that mentality can really be embraced and drive action and accomplishment.

### Closing

So with that, I'm going to wrap up.

Let me again thank you for taking the time. I teased you about not telling you how long this was going to go. I budgeted 90 minutes. I think I'm at about 88. So hey, I'll score that a one on the OKRs.

**Please fill out the feedback form,** for those of you here in person or watching online. The data is critical, as you know, not only from this presentation but from others. We are very data-driven as a group. Not just the quantitative score that gives us a sense of how we're doing on that 1-to-7 scale, but also the qualitative. What takeaways did you get from this event? Knowing what resonates helps me when I think about planning future topics - really know what to focus on and how to steer presenters. So that's really critical.

**Topics:** Again, as I said at the beginning of this workshop, if you've got a topic that you would like to see us cover, I want to know what it is. I want to hear from you. My job is to find the expertise and experience at Google and make it available to you. It's a great job. I love doing it. But I'd rather not be prescriptive and tell you what I think you should know. I'd rather know what you think you need to know so that I can make that available.

**Stay tuned on the announcement list.** We've got a lot of stuff coming up for the balance of Q4 and starting to do a lot of planning for Q1. Really excited about some changes in approach and format.

So looking forward to seeing you again online, in person. Until then, thank you again. We'll see you soon.

Bye-bye!

# PART 2: Rick Klau's 2022 Updates & Reflections

*"What I Got Wrong" - Evolution of OKR Thinking (2013-2022)*

---

## Introduction to 2022 Updates

After nearly 10 years and over 1 million views of his famous 2013 OKR workshop video, Rick Klau reflected on what he would change, emphasize differently, or add based on a decade of consulting experience with hundreds of companies.

**Sources:**
- tins.rklau.com (Rick's personal blog)
- Weekly posts on OKRs (2013-2022)
- Consulting work with Google Ventures portfolio companies
- Role as California's Chief Technology Innovation Officer

**Why These Updates Matter:**
- Based on real-world implementation across hundreds of companies
- Honest reflection on what the 2013 video missed or under-emphasized
- New concepts (Red Team Reviews, Institutional Memory)
- Evolution of best practices

---

## Key Corrections & Updates

### 1. Saying NO is Crucial (Should Have Shouted This)

**What Rick Got Wrong in 2013:**
- Mentioned saying "no" briefly
- Didn't emphasize it enough
- Should have "shouted it from the rafters"

**Why It Matters:**

OKRs give teams **permission** to reject good ideas.

**The Problem:**
- Most teams struggle to say no to well-intentioned requests
- Everything seems important
- Constant context-switching kills execution
- Good ideas become distractions from great ideas

**Rick's Updated Insight:**
> "What a team chooses NOT to do is at least as important as what you say yes to."

**Practical Impact - When teams know their OKRs:**
- ✅ Can confidently decline feature requests that don't align
- ✅ Can say no to partnerships that seem interesting but don't support objectives
- ✅ Can reject internal projects that are distractions
- ✅ Can prioritize: "Good idea, but not the MOST important right now"

**The Shift:**
OKRs aren't just about what you'll work on - they're primarily about what you WON'T work on.

---

### 2. Skip Individual OKRs Initially

**What Rick Got Wrong in 2013:**
- Covered individual, team, and company OKRs as if they should all launch together
- Didn't warn that individual OKRs can be confusing/frustrating early on

**Updated Recommendation:**
- ❌ **Ignore individual OKRs** when first implementing the framework
- ✅ Start with company OKRs only
- ✅ Add team OKRs once company level is working
- ✅ Make individual OKRs **optional**, if you use them at all

**Why This Change:**
1. Individual OKRs can duplicate job responsibilities
   - "Is this my job duty or a stretch goal?"
   - Creates confusion and overwhelm

2. Company and team alignment is more critical
   - Get organizational alignment first
   - Individual alignment follows naturally

3. Reduces implementation complexity
   - Fewer moving parts
   - Easier to learn
   - Less cognitive load

**When to Consider Individual OKRs (If Ever):**
- After company and team OKRs are well-established (2-3 quarters minimum)
- When individuals need specific focus beyond normal duties
- As a growth/development tool, not requirement
- Optional, never mandatory

---

### 3. Focus on Outcomes, Not Activities (Needs MUCH More Emphasis)

**What Rick Got Wrong in 2013:**
- Mentioned outcomes briefly
- Didn't warn strongly enough against "activity" metrics
- Should have made this a central, repeated theme

**The Problem with Activity-Based Key Results:**

Bad metrics only capture work, not impact:
- "Lines of code written"
- "Meetings held"
- "Features shipped"
- "Blog posts published"

**Why This is Dangerous:**
- Can achieve all activities with zero business impact
- Incentivizes wrong behaviors (quantity over quality)
- Misses the point of WHY you're doing the work

**Good vs Bad Key Results:**

| ❌ Bad (Activity) | ✅ Good (Outcome) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Write 5 blog posts | Increase blog traffic by 30% |
| Ship 3 features | Increase engagement by 20% |
| Hold 10 customer calls | Increase NPS by 15 points |
| Hire 2 engineers | Reduce deployment time by 50% |

**The Principle:**
> "Measure the **impact** you want, not just the work you'll do."

**The Test:**
If you could do all the work and have zero business impact, it's a bad key result.

**Why Outcomes Force Better Thinking:**
- Must understand WHY you're doing the work
- Must define what success looks like
- Must measure real business value
- Can't game the system as easily

---

### 4. Separate OKRs from Performance Reviews (Shout This from Rafters!)

**What Rick Got Wrong in 2013:**
- Mentioned separation briefly
- Treated it as a side note
- Didn't emphasize how CRITICAL this is

**2022 Updated Stance:**
This should be a **foundational, non-negotiable principle** - emphasized repeatedly, loudly, and early.

**Why This is ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL:**

Rick's 2022 Quote:
> "If you use OKRs as a performance review (which often has a compensation component tied to it), you're going to encourage your teams to sandbag their OKRs, and set entirely achievable goals so they can get their bonus."

**The Fundamental Tension:**
- **OKRs work best:** 60-70% achievement (ambitious, stretch goals)
- **Performance reviews want:** 100% achievement (reliable, predictable)
- **→ These are fundamentally incompatible!**

**What Happens If You Mix Them:**
1. ❌ Teams sandbag (set easy goals to guarantee bonus)
2. ❌ No ambition - kills the entire point of OKRs
3. ❌ No permission to take risks
4. ❌ Innovation dies
5. ❌ OKRs become meaningless paperwork

**How to Properly Handle:**

**Use OKRs for:**
- Alignment across teams
- Prioritization (what to work on)
- Learning (what worked, what didn't)
- Focus (what NOT to work on)

**Use Performance Reviews for:**
- Quality of work overall
- Team collaboration & culture fit
- Growth and learning mindset
- Impact beyond just OKRs
- Long-term potential

**Can Reference OKRs in Reviews:**
- ✅ As context ("here's what I worked on")
- ✅ As one data point among many
- ❌ **NOT** as a scoring mechanism
- ❌ **NOT** tied directly to compensation

**The Bottom Line:**
If your OKR score directly impacts your bonus, your OKRs will become useless.

---

## New Concepts (Post-2013)

### Red Team OKRs (2022 Innovation)

**What is Red Teaming?**
Use an adversarial approach to review draft OKRs - try to break them before implementing.

**Core Question:**
> "Could we harm the company by successfully achieving these goals?"

**What This Reveals:**
- Goals that can be gamed
- Metrics that incentivize wrong behavior
- Focus areas that cause teams to ignore critical work

---

#### Common OKR Vulnerabilities:

**1. Lack of Clear Metrics**

**Problem:**
- Key results are vague
- Can't objectively grade
- Room for interpretation
- Can claim success without actual improvement

**Example:**
- ❌ Bad: "Improve user experience"
- ✅ Fixed: "Reduce average task completion time by 30%"

---

**2. Not Ambitious Enough**

**Problem:**
- Goals too easy
- Will definitely hit 100%
- Not stretching the team
- Just documenting normal work

**Red Team Question:**
- "Could we achieve this while watching Netflix?"
- "Is this challenging or just our BAU (business as usual)?"

**Fix:**
- Make goals uncomfortable
- Aim for 60-70% confidence
- Push boundaries

---

**3. Too Many Goals**

**Problem:**
- 10+ objectives per team
- No real focus
- Everything is a priority = nothing is a priority
- Fragmented energy, no momentum

**Red Team Question:**
- "If we could only pick 3, which would they be?"
- "What are we actually saying NO to?"

**Fix:**
- Ruthlessly limit to 3-5 objectives
- Each objective gets serious attention
- Everything else explicitly waits

---

#### Examples of Vulnerable OKRs:

| Vulnerable OKR | How It Could Hurt Company | Fixed Version |
|----------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| "Launch 5 features" | Ship junk features that hurt UX | "Launch 5 features that each increase engagement by 10%+" |
| "Reduce costs by 30%" | Cut essential services, hurt quality | "Reduce costs by 30% while maintaining CSAT above 85" |
| "Increase sales by 50%" | Take on bad customers, hurt retention | "Increase sales by 50% with <10% churn rate" |
| "Ship on time" | Ship buggy product, hurt brand | "Ship on time with <5 P0 bugs and >90% test coverage" |

**The Pattern:**
Every vulnerable OKR can be fixed by adding a **quality gate** that prevents gaming.

---

#### Red Team Review Process:

**Step 1: Put on Adversarial Hat**
- Your job is to break these OKRs
- Find ways to "succeed" while hurting the company
- Be creative with edge cases
- Think like a saboteur

**Step 2: Ask Critical Questions**
- Could we achieve this with zero business impact?
- What bad behaviors might this incentivize?
- What critical work might this cause us to ignore?
- Can we game the metrics easily?
- Are we measuring activity or outcome?

**Step 3: Test for Outcome vs Activity**
- Does this measure real impact?
- Or just "did stuff"?
- Can we fail at outcome while succeeding at activity?

**Step 4: Rewrite Vulnerable OKRs**
- Add quality gates
- Focus on outcomes
- Make gaming impossible (or obvious)
- Ensure: Good OKR grade = Good business results

---

#### When to Red Team:

**Timing:**
- After first draft of OKRs
- Before finalizing for the quarter
- During OKR review meetings (leadership + team)

**Who Should Do It:**
- Someone NOT on the team (fresh eyes)
- Skeptical/critical thinker
- Understands the business context
- Can be a rotating role

**Benefits:**
- Catch vulnerabilities early
- Dramatically improve OKR quality
- Force clearer, sharper thinking
- Build better metrics
- Prevent disasters down the road

---

### OKRs as Institutional Memory (2022 Innovation)

**Core Concept:**
OKRs aren't just goal-setting tools - they're a mechanism for capturing and transmitting organizational knowledge over time.

**The Problem Without OKRs:**

**Knowledge Loss Scenario:**
1. Person tries approach X in 2020
2. Doesn't work, learns why
3. Person leaves company in 2021
4. New person joins in 2022
5. Suggests approach X (doesn't know it failed)
6. Team can't remember why they didn't do it
7. **→ Repeat the same failure**

**This is organizational amnesia** - expensive and demoralizing.

---

#### How OKRs Preserve Memory:

**1. Document Original Intent**

**Without OKRs:**
"We tried to grow sales last year, didn't work out."

**With OKRs:**
- **Q2 2020:** Objective "Grow enterprise sales"
- **Key Result:** "Sign 10 enterprise customers at >$100K each"
- **Grade:** 0.3 (only signed 3 customers)
- **Learnings:** "Enterprise sales cycle is 9 months, we gave it 3 months. Need longer runway and dedicated sales engineer."

**Value for Future Team:**
- Knows what was tried
- Understands why it didn't work
- Can build on the learning (e.g., 9-month sales cycle insight)
- Won't repeat the mistake
- Can try different approach informed by data

---

**2. Track Iteration and Learning**

**The Power of Historical OKRs:**

Rick's Quote:
> "With OKRs, the lessons from past quarters jump off the page: that team tried to do X, didn't succeed, they iterated in future quarters based on what they learned, and achieved Y."

**Example Evolution (Retention Problem):**

**Q1 2020:** "Launch feature X to increase retention"
- Grade: 0.2 - feature didn't move the needle
- Learning: Features alone don't drive retention

**Q2 2020:** "Improve onboarding to increase retention"
- Grade: 0.5 - some impact, but not enough
- Learning: Onboarding helps but insufficient

**Q3 2020:** "Implement usage triggers to drive retention"
- Grade: 0.8 - this worked!
- Learning: Usage triggers are the key

**Q4 2020:** "Scale usage triggers to all user segments"
- Grade: 0.9 - scaled successfully across entire user base

**What New Team Member Learns in 15 Minutes:**
- Team tried multiple approaches (didn't give up)
- Features alone didn't work (skip this)
- Onboarding helped but wasn't enough (nice-to-have, not solution)
- Usage triggers were the breakthrough (this is the answer)
- Now scaled across user base (current state)

**This would have taken MONTHS to learn through osmosis.**

---

**3. Onboard New Team Members Rapidly**

**Traditional Onboarding (Weeks to Months):**
- Read scattered docs
- Shadow team members
- Sit in meetings
- Learn through osmosis and repeated questions
- Takes 2-3 months to understand "why we do things this way"

**OKR-Based Onboarding (Days):**
- Read last 4 quarters of team OKRs (2 hours)
- See what team prioritized
- Understand what worked/didn't work
- Learn reasoning behind current approach
- Ask informed questions
- **Get 80% context in first week**

**What New Member Gains:**
- Historical context (why we're here)
- Strategic thinking evolution
- Failed experiments (don't repeat these)
- Successful patterns (amplify these)
- Team's learning journey
- Current priorities + reasoning

---

#### The Anti-Pattern: Editing OKRs Mid-Quarter

**What People Want to Do:**
1. Quarter isn't going well
2. Realize original goal was wrong or impossible
3. Edit the OKR to match what actually happened
4. Look successful on paper
5. Feel better about "hitting targets"

**Why This is Terrible:**

Rick's Strong Warning:
> "OKRs should NOT be casually edited mid-quarter, as doing so erases the organizational memory."

**What You Lose by Editing:**
- Record of what you actually tried
- Learnings about what didn't work
- Honest assessment of real challenges
- Ability to learn from mistakes
- Future team's ability to understand the past
- Trust (looks like you're gaming the system)

**Real Cost:**
Next team will try the same thing, fail the same way, because the failure was hidden.

**The Right Approach:**
1. ✅ Keep original OKR intact
2. ✅ Document why you couldn't achieve it
3. ✅ Add detailed learnings to the grade/comments
4. ✅ Update strategy for next quarter
5. ✅ Preserve the truth, ugly as it may be

**Exception (Rare):**
- Catastrophic external event (e.g., global pandemic)
- Complete company pivot
- Critical assumptions invalidated
- Even then: Don't delete, add context

---

#### Implementation Tips:

**1. Don't Delete Failed OKRs**
- Every failure teaches something valuable
- Failed OKRs are precious data
- Keep complete, honest history
- Low scores ≠ shame, they equal learning

**2. Add Rich Context to Grades**
- Don't just write "0.3"
- Add WHY in comments:
  - What happened?
  - What blocked us?
  - What did we learn?
  - What would we do differently?

**Example:**
```
Grade: 0.3

Context: We only signed 3 of 10 target enterprise customers.

What we learned:
- Enterprise sales cycle is 9 months, not 3
- Need dedicated sales engineer (don't have one)
- Legal review adds 6-8 weeks we didn't account for
- Our pricing was 30% too high for this segment

What we'd do differently:
- Start earlier (9-month runway)
- Hire sales engineer first
- Simplify contract (reduce legal time)
- Adjust pricing model for enterprise
```

**3. Make OKRs Searchable**
- Tag by theme/area (e.g., #retention, #enterprise, #mobile)
- Easy to find past experiments
- Answer: "Have we tried this before?"
- Build on history, don't repeat it

**4. Review Old OKRs in Planning**
- Before setting new OKRs, review last 4 quarters
- What patterns emerge?
- What did we learn?
- What worked? What didn't?
- How should learnings inform next quarter?

**5. Use in Retrospectives**
- "What did we say we'd do?" (check OKRs)
- "What actually happened?" (reality check)
- "What did we learn?" (extract insights)
- "How do we apply learnings?" (action items for next Q)

---

#### The Compounding Value Over Time:

**Year 1 of OKRs:**
- Help with alignment and focus
- Some learning captured
- Still figuring it out
- Modest value

**Year 2:**
- Start seeing patterns across quarters
- Avoid repeating known mistakes
- Build on documented successes
- Measurable efficiency gains

**Year 3+:**
- Rich organizational history
- New members onboard in days, not months
- Strategic decisions informed by years of data
- Institutional knowledge compounds
- OKRs become MORE valuable, not less

**Rick's Powerful Insight:**
> "OKRs are like a compound interest account for organizational learning. The value grows exponentially over time."

---

## Other Notable Insights (2022 Blog Posts)

### "Binary: Good for Code, Bad for OKRs"

**Problem with Binary Key Results:**
- Can only be 0 or 1 (e.g., "Launch product")
- Hard to assess progress mid-quarter
- Can't calibrate ambition level
- No gradient for learning

**Examples:**
- ❌ Bad: "Launch product" (binary - either launched or not)
- ✅ Good: "Reach 10,000 active users post-launch" (measurable gradient)

**Why This Matters:**
- Mid-quarter check-ins are meaningless for binary goals
- Can't tell if you're on track until the end
- Hard to adjust tactics
- Reduces learning opportunities

---

### "Throw Away the Rabbits"

**Metaphor:**
- "Rabbits" = good ideas that distract from great ideas
- Chasing rabbits = pursuing every opportunity
- Result: catch nothing

**The Insight:**
- Must actively throw away good ideas
- OKRs help identify what to ignore
- Focus means saying no to 90% of opportunities
- Better: One big goal achieved than ten small goals attempted

**Practical Application:**
When rabbit appears, ask:
1. "Is this in our OKRs?"
2. If no: "Should we change our OKRs or ignore the rabbit?"
3. Forces conscious decision, not reactive pursuit

---

### "Squirrels Can Kill the Vibe"

**Similar concept to "rabbits":**
- Squirrels = shiny object syndrome
- Constantly getting distracted by new ideas
- Kills momentum and morale
- OKRs provide anchor to resist

**The Pattern:**
1. Team is focused, making progress
2. Exciting new idea appears (squirrel!)
3. Team gets distracted, loses momentum
4. Original goal suffers
5. Neither goal achieved well

**The Fix:**
OKRs as shield:
- "Interesting idea, but it's not in our OKRs"
- "Let's add to backlog and review next quarter"
- "Stays focused = stays effective"

---

### "Where Do Our OKRs Belong?"

**Key Point:**
- OKRs must be in ONE central location
- Can't be scattered across docs/tools/emails
- Single source of truth mandatory
- Everyone must know where to find them

**Why This Matters:**
- If hard to find → people won't look
- If not updated in one place → versions diverge
- Multiple sources → confusion, conflicts
- Single location → transparency automatic

**Recommended Approach:**
- Company wiki (one page per quarter)
- OKR software (if established process)
- Google Sites / Notion
- Any tool that's:
  - Accessible to everyone
  - Easy to update
  - Version controlled
  - Always available

---

### "How Important Are Quarterly Goals?"

**Key Point:**
- Quarterly cadence isn't dogma
- Adapt to your context and feedback loops
- Some goals need longer timeframes
- Some need shorter

**When to Deviate from Quarterly:**

**Monthly OKRs:**
- Very early startup (pre-product-market fit)
- Rapid iteration phase
- Weekly/bi-weekly sprint cycles
- Fast-moving consumer apps

**Bi-Annual or Annual OKRs:**
- Long-term R&D projects
- Major platform rebuilds
- Hardware development (long cycles)
- Regulatory/compliance initiatives

**Quarterly is Good Default For:**
- Most product development work
- B2B SaaS companies
- Established companies scaling
- Balances urgency + strategic thinking

**The Principle:**
Match OKR cadence to your natural feedback loops.

## How NOT to Draft Your First OKRs (2022 Case Study)

Rick worked with a leadership team implementing OKRs for the first time. Shows "textbook example of What Not To Do."

### Anti-Pattern #1: Lack of True Prioritization

**What Went Wrong:**
- Team created long list of "priorities"
- Everything labeled as important
- No clear focus on what matters MOST
- Avoided hard choices

**The Illusion:**
- Lists are easy (everything is "a priority")
- Prioritization is hard (this, not that)
- Teams want to keep everyone happy
- Result: No one is happy, nothing gets done well

**The Reality:**
- Real prioritization means rank ordering
- Means saying "this is MORE important than that"
- Means explicitly moving good ideas to "not now"
- Uncomfortable but essential

**The Fix:**

**Use Structured Prioritization:**
- Voting with dots/post-its (each leader gets 3 votes)
- Forced ranking (order top 10 by importance)
- "If we could only do 3 things this quarter" exercise
- Make it visual, make it real

**Leadership Must Make Hard Choices Together:**
- Can't delegate this
- Can't avoid conflict
- Must have difficult conversations
- Must align on trade-offs

**Explicitly Move Good Ideas to "Not Now" Backlog:**
- Acknowledge they're good ideas
- Document them for later
- Give team permission to ignore them this quarter
- Reduces guilt, increases focus

---

### Anti-Pattern #2: Poor Cross-Team Coordination

**What Went Wrong:**
- Individual teams drafted OKRs independently
- No discussion of dependencies
- Critical company initiatives almost missed
- Silos reinforced instead of broken

**Real Example from Rick's Client:**
- Team was planning major European expansion
- Would require marketing, sales, product, legal coordination
- Each team drafted their OKRs separately
- **European expansion almost didn't appear in ANY team's OKRs!**
- Why? Each team assumed someone else owned it
- Would have been a disaster if not caught

**The Problem:**
- Teams optimize for their own goals
- Miss opportunities for collaboration
- Can work at cross-purposes
- Company-level priorities get lost in the cracks

**The Fix:**

**Leadership Discusses Company OKRs FIRST:**
- Before teams draft anything
- Identify 3-5 company-level objectives
- Make dependencies explicit
- Assign clear owners

**Alignment Meeting Before Finalization:**
- All teams present draft OKRs
- Discuss dependencies openly
- Identify gaps and overlaps
- Adjust before committing

**Ensure Critical Initiatives Have Clear Owners:**
- Can't assume "someone" will do it
- Explicit ownership in OKRs
- Cross-functional initiatives need coordinating team
- Make the invisible visible

---

### Anti-Pattern #3: Overlooking Critical Objectives

**What Went Wrong:**
- Teams focused on their usual ongoing work
- Forgot about major strategic initiatives
- New/different/transformative projects got dropped
- Documented the present, not the future

**Why This Happens:**
- Easy to document ongoing work (we're already doing it)
- Harder to identify new priorities (requires thinking)
- Strategic initiatives often lack clear owners early on
- Teams assume strategic stuff is "obvious" (it's not)
- Comfort bias - stick with what we know

**The Danger:**
- OKRs become a mirror of current state
- No change, no transformation
- Strategic goals get lost
- Busy but not improving

**The Fix:**

**Start Planning with: "What's Changing This Year?"**
- Not "What are we doing?"
- But "What's DIFFERENT?"
- Forces focus on transformation
- Highlights strategic initiatives

**Explicitly Discuss Strategic Initiatives:**
- List them out
- Don't assume they're obvious
- Assign owners early
- Make them OKRs, not side projects

**Reality Check Question:**
"If we achieve all our OKRs but nothing strategic changes, did we succeed?"
- If answer is NO → missing critical objectives
- Need to add transformation goals

---

### Recommended First-Time Approach:

**Step 1: Collaborative Prioritization**
1. Get all leaders in room (in person if possible)
2. Brainstorm ALL possible priorities (no judgment phase)
3. Use voting/ranking to identify true top 3
4. Explicitly create "not now" list (visible to all)
5. Leadership aligns on the hard choices

**Step 2: Strict Focus**
1. Limit company OKRs to 3 objectives maximum (maybe 5 if must)
2. Each objective has 3-5 key results
3. Everything else goes to documented backlog
4. Give teams PERMISSION to ignore backlog items
5. Repeat: "If it's not in OKRs, don't work on it"

**Step 3: Organic Alignment (Not Top-Down Mandates)**
1. Share company OKRs with all teams
2. Let team priorities emerge through discussion
3. Don't force rigid cascading
4. Help teams see how their work connects to company goals
5. Create space for honest conversations about capacity

**Step 4: Reality Check Session**
1. All teams present draft OKRs to leadership + each other
2. Ask: "Did we forget anything critical?"
3. Review strategic initiatives list (check against OKRs)
4. Check for cross-team dependencies (make explicit)
5. Ensure all critical work has an owner
6. Adjust before finalizing

---

## Key Themes Across All 2022 Updates

### 1. Simplicity Over Complexity
- Don't over-engineer the process
- Keep tools lightweight
- Focus on principles, not bureaucracy
- Complexity kills adoption

### 2. Outcomes Over Outputs (Cannot Emphasize Enough)
- Measure impact, not activity
- Focus on business results
- Avoid vanity metrics
- Quality gates prevent gaming
- This is THE most important update

### 3. Learning Over Perfection
- Low scores are data, not failure
- Failed OKRs teach the most valuable lessons
- Preserve history obsessively
- Iterate based on evidence
- Compound knowledge over time

### 4. Focus Over Breadth
- 3-5 objectives maximum (fewer is better)
- Saying NO is as important as saying YES
- Clear priorities enable deep execution
- Everything can't be important
- Rabbits and squirrels will try to distract you

### 5. Transparency Over Privacy
- Everyone sees everyone's OKRs (no exceptions)
- Public grading (vulnerable but essential)
- Open discussion of failures (builds trust)
- Single source of truth
- Builds alignment automatically

### 6. Separation of Concerns (CRITICAL)
- OKRs ≠ performance reviews (shout this!)
- OKRs ≠ project management
- OKRs ≠ job descriptions
- Each tool has its purpose
- Don't mix them or you'll break them

---

## Evolution Summary: What Stayed vs What Changed

### What Stayed the Same (Core Principles):
- ✅ Measurability is absolutely critical
- ✅ Transparency is non-negotiable
- ✅ Target 60-70% achievement
- ✅ Quarterly cadence works for most
- ✅ Grading is essential for learning

### What Changed (Emphasis & New Concepts):

**Individual OKRs:**
- 2013: Include individual OKRs
- **2022: Skip them initially, optional later**

**Performance Separation:**
- 2013: Mentioned briefly
- **2022: SHOUT THIS FROM RAFTERS**

**Outcomes vs Outputs:**
- 2013: Mentioned
- **2022: Needs MUCH more emphasis**

**Saying NO:**
- 2013: Mentioned
- **2022: As important as saying YES**

**New Concepts (Post-2013):**
- **Red Team Reviews** (should be standard)
- **Institutional Memory** (key long-term value)
- **Quality Gates** (prevent gaming)
- **Activity vs Outcome distinction** (central theme)

---

## Why This Evolution Matters

**Shows Intellectual Honesty:**
- Willing to say "I got this wrong"
- Based on real evidence (hundreds of implementations)
- Continuously improving the framework
- Practitioner mindset, not dogma

**Reflects Real-World Learning:**
- 2013 video was based on Google's experience
- 2022 updates based on diverse company experiences
- Startups to enterprises
- Different industries and contexts
- Thousands of hours of consulting

**Makes OKRs More Accessible:**
- Simpler starting point (company OKRs only)
- Clearer warnings (when not to use OKRs)
- Better defenses (Red Team, Quality Gates)
- More value articulation (Institutional Memory)

**The Bottom Line:**
The 2013 framework was good. The 2022 framework is battle-tested and better.

## Applying Rick's Complete Framework (2013 + 2022)

**Step 0: Before You Start (Prerequisites)**
1. Get genuine leadership commitment (not lip service)
2. Decide: company/team OKRs only initially (skip individual)
3. Choose simple tool (wiki, Google Sites, Notion - not enterprise software yet)
4. Establish quarterly calendar (when start, mid-check, end-review)
5. Communicate: OKRs ≠ performance reviews (repeat ad nauseam)

**Step 1: Company OKRs (Leadership)**
1. Collaborative prioritization session (all leaders, in person if possible)
2. Identify 3 (max 5) company objectives
3. Write measurable key results (outcomes, not outputs!)
4. **Red Team review** for vulnerabilities
5. Add quality gates to prevent gaming
6. Communicate clearly to entire company (all-hands, written doc, Q&A)

**Step 2: Team OKRs (Bottom-Up with Guidance)**
1. Teams draft based on company OKRs (how we support)
2. Check for cross-team dependencies (make explicit)
3. Ensure all critical company initiatives have owners
4. **Red Team review** at team level
5. Alignment session (all teams present to each other)
6. Publish publicly (one central location)

**Step 3: Execute (Quarterly Focus)**
1. Make OKRs visible and accessible (wiki, dashboard, posted)
2. Weekly/bi-weekly check-ins (are we on track?)
3. Mid-quarter reality check (major adjustments needed?)
4. **DON'T edit OKRs mid-quarter** (preserve learning)
5. Course-correct tactics, not goals

**Step 4: Grade & Learn (End of Quarter)**
1. Grade honestly (aim for 0.6-0.7, celebrate that!)
2. Document rich learnings, not just scores:
   - What worked? Why?
   - What didn't? Why?
   - What surprised us?
   - External factors?
   - What to change next time?
3. Present grades publicly (all-hands or team meetings)
4. Discuss patterns and insights
5. **Preserve complete history** (don't delete failures!)

**Step 5: Repeat & Compound (Long-Term Value)**
1. Review last 4 quarters' patterns before planning next
2. Draft next quarter's OKRs informed by learnings
3. Iterate and improve based on evidence
4. Watch organizational knowledge compound
5. Onboard new members via OKR history
6. Build institutional memory over years

---

**The Most Valuable 2022 Insight:**

Rick Klau's Reflection:
> "OKRs are a learning system first, a goal-setting system second. The real value compounds over years as organizational knowledge accumulates. The 2013 video taught goal-setting. The 2022 updates teach organizational learning."
