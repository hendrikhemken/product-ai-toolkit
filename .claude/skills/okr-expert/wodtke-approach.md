# Christina Wodtke's OKR Approach

*Weekly rhythm, radical focus, 5/10 confidence*

---

## Core Philosophy

> "The secret to OKRs is not the framework, it's the cadence."

**Wodtke's Belief:**
OKRs are a **commitment system, not a control system**. They empower teams with autonomy while creating focus through weekly rituals.

**Key Principles:**
- Focus > Coverage
- Learning > Hitting 1.0
- Weekly cadence is THE differentiator
- Trust teams to find their path
- Simplicity over sophistication

---

## Who This Is For

**Ideal Companies:**
- Startups (5-50 people)
- Fast-moving product teams
- High autonomy environments
- First-time OKR implementation

**NOT For:**
- Large enterprises needing coordination (200+)
- Teams that can't commit to weekly meetings
- Feature factories without autonomy

---

## OKR Structure

### Objective (Qualitative)

**Criteria:**
- ✅ Inspirational & motivating
- ✅ Time-bound (quarterly)
- ✅ Actionable by team independently
- ✅ Uses team's language ("crush it", "dominate", "launch amazing")

**Good Examples:**
- "Control the direct-to-business coffee market in South Bay"
- "Launch an MVP that customers love"
- "Transform onboarding into a wow experience"

**Bad Examples (they're KRs!):**
- "Increase sales 30%" (has number)
- "Double users" (has number)

### Key Results (Quantitative)

**Ask:** "How would we know if we met our objective?"

**Characteristics:**
- 3 per objective (not more, not less)
- Measurable with numbers
- Outcome-based (NOT activity)
- Balance competing forces (growth vs. quality)

**Example:**
```
Objective: Launch an MVP that customers love

Key Results:
- 40% of users return twice in one week
- NPS score of 8 or higher
- 15% conversion rate from signup to paid
```

**Balancing Forces:**
- Growth + Performance
- Revenue + Quality
- Speed + Stability

### The 5/10 Confidence Level

**Wodtke's Signature Innovation:**

Set confidence at **5 out of 10** = 50/50 shot of success

**Scale:**
- 1/10 = Never gonna happen
- **5/10 = Sweet spot** ✅
- 10/10 = Sandbagging (too easy)

**The "Pit of Stomach" Test:**
> "If you're getting a funny little feeling in the pit of your stomach saying 'It would take a miracle to hit all three...' then you're probably setting them correctly."

**Update Weekly:**
- Confidence moves up? Why? (Discuss!)
- Confidence moves down? Why? (Adjust tactics!)
- Learning comes from understanding WHY it changed

---

## Health Metrics (Guard Rails)

**What Are They?**
> "Things you don't want to forget or sacrifice while aiming to achieve key results"

**Purpose:**
- Protect critical business functions
- Prevent over-optimization on OKRs
- Act as counter-balances

**Examples:**
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Team morale / health
- Code stability / tech debt
- Key customer relationships
- Response time / uptime
- Churn rate

**How Many?**
2-3 maximum per team

**Color Coding:**
- 🟢 Green = All fine, continue
- 🟡 Yellow = Watch closely
- 🔴 Red = Code Red! Fix immediately

**Code Red Protocol:**
> "Red means something critical is in freefall. Call 'Code Red' and prioritize fix over OKR efforts."

---

## Weekly Cadence (THE SECRET SAUCE)

### Monday Commitments Meeting

**Purpose:** Plan the week toward OKRs

**Four Key Areas:**

**1. Intention for the Week**
- What are the 3-4 most important things to get done?
- Do these move us toward OKRs?

**2. Forecast for the Month**
- What's coming that team should know?
- What can others help with?

**3. Status Toward OKRs**
- Update confidence levels (still 5/10?)
- **CRITICAL:** Discuss WHY confidence changed
- Adjust tactics based on learnings

**4. Health Metrics Check**
- Review 2-3 guard rail metrics
- Flag yellow/red immediately
- Code Red if needed

**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

---

### Friday Celebration Meeting

**Purpose:** Share progress & wins

**What Happens:**
- Demo completed work
- Share what you accomplished
- Learn what others did
- **CELEBRATE!** (critical for motivation)

**Why This Matters:**
> "This meeting motivates individuals to get work done and seek wins."

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

### Why Weekly Rhythm Works

**Wodtke's Core Insight:**
> "OKRs are set quarterly, but the magic happens weekly."

**Benefits:**
- Prevents "set and forget"
- Creates learning cadence on top of execution cadence
- Builds culture of commitment
- Early blocker identification
- Continuous course-correction

**Integration:**
> "Bake your OKRs into weekly team meetings and status emails. Adjust confidence levels every single week."

---

## Grading System (Simple)

### For Small Orgs (< 50 people)

**De-emphasize numerical grading**

**Focus on:**
- What worked? Why?
- What didn't work? Why?
- What did we learn?
- What should we do differently?

**Confidence as Grade:**
- Started at 5/10
- Ended at 6-7/10? → Success! ✅
- Ended at 10/10? → Too conservative
- Ended at 2-3/10? → Too ambitious or wrong approach

### For Larger Orgs (200+)

**Use 0.0-1.0 scale** (similar to Klau)

**Target:** 0.6-0.7 = success

**Why Qualitative > Quantitative:**

**Wodtke's 2024 Evolution:**
> "I now use a qualitative approach that emphasizes insights over numbers, focusing on what worked, what didn't, and what to do differently instead of getting stuck on 0.7 vs 0.8."

## Timeline & Cadence

### Quarter Start (Week 1)

**Preparation:**
1. Review mission & strategy
2. Analyze previous quarter results
3. Gather team input
4. Identify constraints & resources

**OKR Creation:**
1. Draft objective (qualitative, inspirational)
2. Define 3 key results (5/10 confidence)
3. Select 2-3 health metrics
4. Get team alignment

**Launch:**
- Present OKRs to team
- Explain "why" behind objective
- Set confidence levels
- Commit to week 1 priorities

### During Quarter (Weeks 2-12)

**Every Monday:**
- Intention for week
- Forecast for month
- Update confidence (WHY changed?)
- Check health metrics

**Every Friday:**
- Demo progress
- Share learnings
- Celebrate wins
- Build momentum

**Monthly:**
- Deeper progress review
- Assess if tactics need adjustment
- Don't change OKRs (learn from them!)

### Quarter End (Week 13)

**Evaluation:**
1. Calculate final confidence or score
2. **Qualitative review:**
   - What worked? Why?
   - What didn't? Why?
   - What surprised us?
   - What to do differently next time?
3. Document learnings
4. Celebrate (even partial success!)

**Wodtke's Rule:**
> "Do not change OKRs halfway through your bounded time period. Suck it up and either fail or blow past them, and use that learning to set them better next time."

## Tools & Systems

**Wodtke's Philosophy: Keep It Simple!**

### Recommended Tools:

**For Startups:**
- ✅ Google Sheets
- ✅ Google Docs
- ✅ Notion
- ✅ Physical boards
- ✅ Whiteboards + sticky notes

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Buy OKR software first
- ❌ Over-engineer the system
- ❌ Use software before process works

**Warning:**
> "Don't buy OKR software before you understand OKRs. You'll just automate bad process."

**When to Add Software:**
- After methodology is understood
- When process is working
- To scale, not to start

---

## Decoupling (Advanced - 2024)

**Evolution: From Approval → Trust**

**Old Way (Cascading):**
- Leadership sets OKRs
- Teams cascade down
- Approval-heavy
- Bureaucratic

**New Way (Decoupling):**
- Leadership shares clear strategy
- Teams self-align
- No approval needed
- Trust-based

**Requirements:**
- High-trust culture
- Clear strategy communication
- Mature teams
- Proven OKR competence

**When to Use:**
- After 2-3 successful quarters
- When trust is high
- When strategy is crystal clear

---

## Prerequisites (CRITICAL!)

**Before implementing OKRs, verify:**

### 1. Clear Strategy Exists

❌ **NO?** → **STOP!**

OKRs execute strategy. Without strategy, OKRs are random.

**Fix:** Create strategy first (Where are we going? Why?)

### 2. Team Has Autonomy

❌ **NO?** → **STOP!**

OKRs are empowerment tools, not control tools.

**Wodtke's Warning:**
> "If your teams don't have autonomy, don't use OKRs. You'll frustrate everyone."

**Fix:** Shift from feature teams to product teams

### 3. Leadership Commitment

❌ **NO?** → **STOP!**

Weekly rhythm requires participation.

**Fix:** Get leadership buy-in or don't start

### 4. Team Controls Priorities

❌ **NO?** → **STOP!**

Service teams, maintenance crews → Use Kanban instead

**Alternatives if Prerequisites Fail:**
- Project management (Jira)
- Kanban for service teams
- Sprint Goals for Agile teams
- Simple to-do lists

---

## Common Mistakes (Wodtke's Perspective)

### 1. Cargo Cult OKRs
**Problem:** Copying Google without understanding

**Fix:** Start simple, understand principles first

### 2. Activity-Based Key Results
**Problem:** Measuring tasks, not outcomes

**Example:**
- ❌ "Ship 3 features"
- ✅ "Increase engagement 30%"

### 3. Using Without Prerequisites
**Problem:** No strategy, no autonomy, no commitment

**Fix:** Check prerequisites FIRST

### 4. Too Many OKRs
**Problem:** Can't focus on everything

**Fix:** 1 company OKR, 1 team OKR supporting it

### 5. No Weekly Cadence
**Problem:** Set and forget

**Wodtke's Insight:**
> "The weekly rhythm is what transforms OKRs from goal-setting to goal-achieving."

### 6. Changing OKRs Mid-Quarter
**Problem:** Dilutes focus, prevents learning

**Fix:** Suck it up, learn from it

---

## Personal OKRs

**Wodtke's Personal Use:**
> "OKRs have changed my life, made my life possible, and are the backbone that holds my life together."

**When to Use Personal OKRs:**

**FOR:**
- ✅ Dreams you're scared to pursue
- ✅ Goals needing radical focus
- ✅ Life changes needing protection

**NOT FOR:**
- ❌ Routine habit tracking
- ❌ Todo lists
- ❌ Basic task completion

**Quote:**
> "OKRs are for things you're worried you're NOT going to do, not for tracking things you will."

**Critical Success Factor:**
> "Find a partner or two to help you stay on track."
