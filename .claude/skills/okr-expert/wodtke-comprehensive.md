## üéØ Core OKR Methodology (Updated Framework)

### The Fundamentals

**OKR Definition:**
- **Objective:** Qualitative, inspirational goal (single sentence)
- **Key Results:** Quantitative measures (typically 3 per objective)
- **Health Metrics:** Guard rails to protect what matters while pursuing OKRs

### Key Principles (2024-2025 Emphasis)

1. **Focus Over Coverage**
   - OKRs cover the single most important thing you must exponentially improve this quarter
   - NOT everything you do - just what needs radical focus
   - "OKRs are for things you're worried you're NOT going to do" - Wodtke

2. **Outcomes Over Outputs**
   - Don't measure "Ship 3 Features"
   - Measure "Increase Engagement by 30%"
   - Latest emphasis: Shifting from output to outcomes is the hardest mental shift

3. **Confidence Over Perfection**
   - 5/10 confidence level = you have a 50/50 shot of success
   - This is the "sweet spot" for ambitious goals
   - Update confidence weekly in team meetings

4. **Cadence Over Campaigns**
   - Weekly rhythm is sacred: Monday Commitments + Friday Celebrations
   - The secret to OKRs is not the framework, it's the **cadence**
   - "OKRs are a vitamin, not a medicine" - they need regular intake

## üèóÔ∏è The Complete Wodtke OKR Framework

### 1. Objective Criteria

An objective must be:

‚úÖ **Qualitative and Inspirational**
- Gets people jumping out of bed with excitement
- Uses the language of your team ("crush it", "kill it", etc.)

‚úÖ **Time Bound**
- Doable in a month or a quarter
- Not a year (that's a strategy, not an objective)

‚úÖ **Actionable by the Team Independently**
- No dependencies on other teams
- No excuses like "Marketing didn't market it"

**Good Objectives:**
- "Control the direct-to-business coffee retail market in the South Bay"
- "Launch an awesome MVP"
- "Transform Palo Alto's coupon using habits"
- "Close a round that lets us kill it next quarter"

**Poor Objectives (they're actually KRs):**
- "Sales numbers up 30%"
- "Double users"
- "Raise a Series B of $5M"

### 2. Key Results Criteria

**Ask:** "How would we know if we met our objective?"

**Characteristics:**
- **Quantitative and measurable**
- **Difficult but not impossible** (5/10 confidence)
- **Typically 3 per objective**
- **Balance competing forces**

**Metrics Categories:**
- Growth
- Engagement
- Revenue
- Performance
- Quality

**Example:** "Launch an Awesome MVP"
- KR1: 40% of users come back twice in one week
- KR2: Recommendation score of 8
- KR3: 15% conversion

**Balancing Forces:**
> "With KRs you can balance forces like growth and performance, or revenue and quality, by making sure you have the potentially opposing forces represented."

### 3. The "5 out of 10" Confidence Level

**Wodtke's Sweet Spot Philosophy:**

- **1/10 confidence:** "Never gonna happen my friend"
- **5/10 confidence:** You have a 50/50 shot of success ‚úÖ **TARGET**
- **10/10 confidence:** Sandbagging (too easy)

**Why 5/10?**
> "You are looking for a sweet spot, where you are pushing yourself and your team to do bigger things and where you have a 50/50 shot of failing."

**Practical Application:**
- Set confidence level at start of quarter
- **Adjust confidence weekly** in Monday meetings
- Discuss why confidence is moving up or down
- Use insights to adapt tactics and priorities

**The "Pit of Stomach" Test:**
> "If you are getting a funny little feeling in the pit of your stomach saying 'It would take a miracle to hit all three of these‚Ä¶' then you are probably setting them correctly."

---

## üóìÔ∏è The Weekly OKR Cadence

### Monday Commitment Meeting

**Four Key Areas:**

**1. Intention for the Week**
- What are the 3-4 most important things to get done toward the Objective?
- Discuss if these priorities move you closer to OKRs

**2. Forecast for the Month**
- What's coming up that the team should know about?
- What can others help with or prepare for?

**3. Status Toward OKRs**
- Update confidence levels (still 5/10? moved up or down?)
- **Discuss WHY confidence changed**
- Adjust tactics based on learnings

**4. Health Metrics Check**
- Review 2-3 things you want to protect while striving for OKRs
- Flag yellow/red metrics immediately

### Friday Celebration Meeting

**Purpose:**
- Share progress and wins
- Demo completed work
- Learn what others accomplished
- **Celebrate achievements** (critical for motivation)

**Why This Matters:**
> "This meeting motivates individuals to get work done and to seek wins."

### The Power of Weekly Rhythm

**Latest Emphasis (2024):**
> "The secret to OKRs is not the framework, it's the cadence."

**Wodtke's Core Insight:**
- OKRs are set quarterly
- But the **magic happens weekly**
- Without weekly check-ins, OKRs become "set and forget"
- Weekly rhythm = cadence of execution + cadence of learning

**Integration:**
> "Bake your OKRs into your weekly team meetings and weekly status emails. Adjust your confidence levels every single week."

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Health Metrics (Guard Rails)

### What Are Health Metrics?

**Definition:**
> "Health metrics sit below objectives and key results, representing things you don't want to forget or sacrifice while aiming to achieve key results."

**Purpose:**
- **Protect critical business functions** while pursuing ambitious OKRs
- **Prevent over-optimization** on objectives at expense of overall health
- **Act as counter-balances** to stretch goals

### How Health Metrics Work

**Color Coding:**
- üü¢ **Green:** All fine, continue
- üü° **Yellow:** Keep watch, potential issue
- üî¥ **Red:** Critical issue, call "Code Red"

**Code Red Protocol:**
> "Red means something critical to the health of the company is in freefall. At this point you call a 'Code Red' and prioritize a fix over OKR efforts."

### Examples of Health Metrics

**Wodtke's Recommendations:**
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Team health / morale
- Code stability / technical debt
- Key customer relationships
- Response time / uptime
- Churn rate

**Best Practices:**
- **Pick 2-3 metrics** (Wodtke: "Pick two things you want to protect as you strive toward greatness")
- Keep to **3-5 maximum** per team
- Review in **every Monday meeting**
- Don't let red metrics persist

### Who Uses Health Metrics vs. OKRs?

**Teams That May Use Health Metrics Instead of OKRs:**
> "Some groups, such as legal or finance, with more predictable schedules than product teams, do not always need OKRs and can use health metrics to keep quality at a steady state."

---

## üìè OKR Grading & Evaluation

### Two Evaluation Systems

Wodtke recommends different systems based on organization size:

#### 1. Confidence Ratings (Startups & Small Orgs)

**For:** 5-50 person companies
**Method:**
- Set confidence level at start (target: 5/10)
- Update weekly based on progress
- Emphasize learning over scoring

**Philosophy:**
- About momentum and adaptation
- Less formal grading needed
- Focus on qualitative insights

#### 2. Grading System (Larger Organizations)

**For:** 200+ person companies
**Method:** Score 0.0 to 1.0

**Scale:**
- **0.0** = Complete failure
- **0.6-0.7** = Target range (like Google) ‚úÖ
- **1.0** = Complete success (often sandbagging)

**Process:**
1. Score each Key Result from 0.0 to 1.0
2. Average the KR scores for overall Objective score
3. Use scores for organizational learning, not performance reviews

### Latest Evolution: Qualitative Over Quantitative

**Wodtke's 2024 Approach:**
> "Wodtke now uses a qualitative grading approach that emphasizes insights over numbers, focusing on what worked, what didn't, and what to do differently instead of getting stuck on a 0.7 or 0.8 score."

**Questions to Ask:**
- What worked? Why?
- What didn't work? Why?
- What should we do differently next quarter?
- What did we learn about our market/product/team?

**Key Principle:**
> "OKRs aren't just about hitting targets but about learning what you are really capable of."

## üåç Enterprise vs. Startup: Wodtke's Dual Approach

### For Startups (5-50 people)

**Characteristics:**
- Weekly rhythm (more agile)
- Confidence ratings (less formal)
- Faster adaptation cycles
- Single company OKR typical
- Fewer dependencies

**Cadence:**

### For Scale-ups & Enterprises (50-200+)

**Characteristics:**
- Quarterly rhythm (more structured)
- 0.0-1.0 grading system
- More cascading/alignment needed
- Multiple team OKRs
- Cross-functional dependencies

**New Challenges (2nd Edition Focus):**
- **Cascading OKRs** without slow waterfalls

- **Communication** at scale
- **Avoiding gaming** the system
- **Integration** with existing processes

**22,000 Words of New Material Addresses:**

## üö´ Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### Mistakes from Recent Content (2024-2025)

**1. Overcomplication**
- **Problem:** Creating too many OKRs, diluting focus
- **Solution:** One company OKR, one supporting OKR per team (Wodtke's recommendation)

**2. Vague Key Results**
- **Problem:** KRs that aren't measurable or concrete
- **Solution:** Ask "How would we know if we met our objective?" and quantify

**3. Ignoring Customer Satisfaction**
- **Problem:** Focusing only on quantitative metrics
- **Solution:** Balance quantitative KRs with qualitative research, use health metrics

**4. Poor Communication**
- **Problem:** Insufficient repetition about OKR purpose and progress
- **Solution:** Weekly status updates, bake OKRs into all team communications

**5. Using OKRs as Performance Reviews**
- **Problem:** Grading individuals instead of learning from results
- **Solution:** Use OKRs for team learning, not individual evaluation

**6. "Set and Forget"**
- **Problem:** Setting OKRs at start of quarter, ignoring until end
- **Solution:** Weekly Monday check-ins, Friday celebrations, continuous adjustment

**7. Treating OKRs as Todo Lists**
- **Problem:** Confusing activities with outcomes
- **Solution:** Remember: Outputs ‚â† Outcomes; focus on results, not tasks

**8. Changing OKRs Mid-Quarter**
- **Problem:** Dilutes focus, prevents learning
- **Wodtke's Rule:** "Do not change OKRs halfway through your bounded time period. Suck it up and either fail or blow past them, and use that learning to set them better next time."

---

## üí° Personal OKRs (Latest Insights)

### Wodtke's Personal Philosophy

**From Her Experience:**
> "OKRs have changed my life, made my life possible, and are the backbone that holds my life together. I think of my personal OKR set as 'a lucky rock in my pocket' that I touch over and over to remind myself of my dreams."

### When to Use Personal OKRs

**Purpose:**
> "OKRs are for things you're worried you're NOT going to do, not for tracking things you will, or to make sure you do well something you might half-ass. Your OKRs exist to protect the dreams you're afraid you'll abandon."

**What Personal OKRs Are NOT For:**
- ‚ùå Tracking routine habits
- ‚ùå Todo lists
- ‚ùå Making sure you do basic tasks

**What Personal OKRs ARE For:**
- ‚úÖ Dreams you're scared to pursue
- ‚úÖ Goals that require radical focus
- ‚úÖ Life changes that need protection from daily chaos

### Setting Personal OKRs

**Start With:**
- What truly matters to you?
- What areas of your life are calling for change?
- What dreams are you afraid you'll abandon?

**Structure:**
- **Objective:** Broad yet meaningful (inspirational)
- **Key Results:** Specific, measurable outcomes (NOT tasks)
- **Time-bound:** Quarter or month

**Wodtke's Advice:**
> "You have to pick an OKR set that fits into your life, considering other obligations like family and work; goals can be as big as a novel, or as small as a garden‚Äîthey're YOUR OKRs."

**Critical Success Factor:**
> "Find a partner or two to help you stay on track."

### 4. The Pre-Work Framework (2024)

**Before Setting OKRs, Complete:**

1. **Mission Clarity:** What's your company/team mission?
2. **Context Setting:** What's happening in market/company?
3. **Resource Assessment:** What do you have to work with?
4. **Constraint Mapping:** What limits your options?
5. **Success Definition:** What does success look like?

**Latest Emphasis (May 2024):**
> "Pre-work for setting OKRs" - foundation building is critical

**Week -1:**
1. Draft objective (qualitative, inspirational)
2. Define 3 key results (quantitative, 5/10 confidence)
3. Select 2-3 health metrics to protect
4. Get team alignment and buy-in

### Phase 2: Launch (Week 1 of Quarter)

**Monday Meeting:**
1. Present OKRs to team
2. Explain "why" behind objective
3. Set confidence levels (target: 5/10)
4. Commit to week 1 priorities

**Throughout Week:**
1. Communicate OKRs repeatedly
2. Connect daily work to objectives
3. Make OKRs visible (walls, Slack, dashboards)

**Friday Meeting:**
1. Share early progress
2. Celebrate any quick wins
3. Adjust week 2 priorities

### Phase 3: Execution (Weeks 2-12)

**Every Monday:**
1. Update confidence levels
2. Discuss why confidence changed
3. Commit to week's 3-4 priorities
4. Check health metrics (red/yellow/green)

**Every Friday:**
1. Demo progress
2. Share learnings
3. Celebrate wins (critical!)
4. Build momentum

**Monthly Check-in:**
1. Deep dive on progress
2. Assess if tactics need adjustment
3. Update stakeholders
4. Don't change OKRs (learn from them)

### Phase 4: Evaluation (End of Quarter)

**Scoring:**
- Grade each KR (0.0-1.0 or confidence achieved)
- Average for overall objective score
- Target range: 0.6-0.7 or 1-2 of 3 KRs achieved

**Qualitative Review (Wodtke's Latest Emphasis):**
1. What worked? Why?
2. What didn't work? Why?
3. What surprised us?
4. What did we learn about our market/product/team?
5. What should we do differently next quarter?

**Wodtke's Principle:**
> "Use that learning to set them better next time."

### Phase 5: Next Cycle

**Immediately After Evaluation:**
1. Document learnings
2. Share insights with broader team
3. Celebrate achievements (even partial)
4. Begin preparation for next quarter

## üéØ Final Takeaways

### Core Philosophy (2024-2025)

1. **Focus is the superpower** - OKRs force radical focus on what matters most
2. **Cadence is the secret** - Weekly rhythm creates momentum and learning
3. **Outcomes over outputs** - Measure results, not activities
4. **Learning over grading** - Use OKRs to discover capabilities, not punish failures
5. **50/50 ambition** - Aim high enough to have a real chance of failing

### Implementation Wisdom

> "OKRs are a vitamin, not a medicine. They require regular intake (weekly rhythm) to work."

> "The secret to OKRs is not the framework, it's the cadence."

> "Start with your best multi-disciplinary team, not a company-wide rollout."

### Evolution of Thought

**Early Wodtke:** OKRs for everyone, startup focus, binary success
**Current Wodtke:** OKRs for what needs focus, enterprise scaling, qualitative learning

### Most Important Insight

From 15 years of OKRs:
> "OKRs exist to protect the dreams you're afraid you'll abandon."
