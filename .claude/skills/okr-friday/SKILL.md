# Friday Celebration - Weekly OKR Check-in

Facilitate a **15-minute** Friday afternoon check-in to celebrate wins and capture learnings (Wodtke's Weekly OKR Cadence).

## Instructions

### 1. Identify Current Week
- What's today's date?
- Which week are we closing? (Calculate from Q4 start date)

### 2. Read Current OKRs & Monday Commitments
**Load:** `/outputs/okrs/Q4-2025-OKRs.md`

**Find:**
- This week's Monday Commitments
- All Key Results (current scores)
- Confidence levels from Monday

### 3. Check What Got Done
- "Let's look at what you committed to Monday..."
- "Which did you complete? Which didn't happen?"
- Mark checkboxes: `[ ]` ‚Üí `[x]` for completed

### 4. Celebrate & Learn
**Ask:**
- "What are you celebrating this week?" (big & small wins!)
- "What worked this week?"
- "What didn't work?"
- "What will you do differently next week?"

**Celebrate everything:**
- Completed actions
- Progress (even 5%)
- Learning ("X doesn't work" is a win!)

### 5. Update Progress
**For EACH KR:**
- "Did this KR move forward this week? By how much?"
- Update "Current" values in the file

### 6. Update OKR File
Update `/outputs/okrs/Q4-2025-OKRs.md`:

**Weekly section:**
```markdown
### Week X (Date Range)

**Monday Commitments:**
- [x] KR1: [completed action]
- [ ] KR2: [not done action]

**Confidence Update:**
[keep from Monday]

**Friday Wins & Learning:**
- üéâ [Win 1]
- üéâ [Win 2]
- üìö Learned: [Learning 1]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è [Blocker if any]
```

**KR section (top of file):**
- Update "Current" values for each KR

### 7. Update CURRENT_WEEK.md
**IMPORTANT:** Update `/outputs/okrs/CURRENT_WEEK.md` with:

- Mark completed checkboxes [x]
- Update "Current Progress" for each KR
- Prepare for next week (move to Week N+1 if next week starts)

**This keeps the current week view accurate!**

### 8. Summarize & Close
**Provide:**
- 2-3 key wins highlighted
- 1-2 key learnings captured
- "Great week! See you Monday!"

**Keep it SHORT - 15 min max!**

[User responds...]

üéâ Awesome wins:
- Client A proposal sent (KR1 progress!)
- 3 LinkedIn posts published (KR2 commitment crushed!)

**What did you LEARN this week?**

[User responds...]

üìö Key learnings:

## File Reference

**Update (2 files!):**
1. `/outputs/okrs/Q4-2025-OKRs.md` (main OKR file - archive of all weeks)
   - Weekly section (checkboxes + Wins & Learning)
   - KR section (Current values)
2. `/outputs/okrs/CURRENT_WEEK.md` (current week only - Single Source of Truth!)

   - Update progress

**CRITICAL:** Both files must be updated every Friday!

**Never:**
- ‚ùå Change target numbers
- ‚ùå Edit OKRs themselves
- ‚ùå Skip weeks
- ‚ùå Forget to update CURRENT_WEEK.md!
