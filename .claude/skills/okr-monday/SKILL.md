# Monday Commitment - Weekly OKR Check-in

Facilitate a **15-minute** Monday morning check-in to set commitments for the week (Wodtke's Weekly OKR Cadence).

## Instructions

### 1. Identify Current Week
- What's today's date?
- Which week are we in? (Calculate from Q4 start date)

### 2. Read Current OKRs
**Load:** `/outputs/okrs/Q4-2025-OKRs.md`

**Find:**
- All Key Results
- Current progress
- Last week's commitments

### 3. Ask For Each KR
For **EACH** Key Result:
- "What's your confidence NOW (0-10) for hitting [KR target] by [end date]?"
- "What are 1-2 CONCRETE actions you'll do THIS WEEK?"

**Push for specificity:**
- ‚ùå "Work on client stuff" ‚Üí Too vague!
- ‚úÖ "Send proposal to Till's CTO" ‚Üí Specific!

### 4. Update OKR File
Update `/outputs/okrs/Q4-2025-OKRs.md` for current week:

```markdown
### Week X (Date Range)

**Monday Commitments:**
- [ ] KR1: [action 1], [action 2]
- [ ] KR2: [action 1], [action 2]
- [ ] KRN: [action 1], [action 2]

**Confidence Update:**
- KR1: X/10
- KR2: X/10
- KRN: X/10
```

### 5. Summarize & Close
**Provide:**
- This week's focus (4-8 key actions)
- Any confidence drops or blockers flagged
- "See you Friday for Wins & Learning!"

**Keep it SHORT - 15 min max!**
