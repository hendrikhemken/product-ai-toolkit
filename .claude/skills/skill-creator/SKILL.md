# Skill Creator
*Create focused, minimal Claude Code Skills*

## When to Use
- User wants to create a new Skill
- User asks "how do I create a skill for..."
- User mentions "skill" + specific use case

---

## 📚 Official Documentation

**Must-Read:**
- 🔥 **Skills Documentation:** https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills.md
- 🔥 **Best Practices Guide:** https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices

**Read these FIRST before creating any Skill!**

---

## 🎯 Key Learnings Summary

**Context is a Public Good:**
- Keep SKILL.md **< 500 lines** (split into files if bigger)
- Every token competes with conversation history
- Only add what Claude doesn't already know

**Description is Critical:**
- ALWAYS write in **third person** ("Processes Excel files", not "I can help...")
- Include **what it does + when to use it**
- List **specific trigger keywords** (file types, scenarios, terms)

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- Keep references **one level deep** from SKILL.md (no nested references!)
- Claude reads files on-demand (no context penalty until accessed)
- Use forward slashes in paths (Unix-style: `reference/guide.md`)

**Workflows & Examples:**
- Complex tasks → provide **checklist** Claude can copy & check off
- Show **input → output examples** (like regular prompting)
- Use **feedback loops** for quality-critical tasks (validate → fix → repeat)

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- ❌ Vague descriptions ("helps with stuff")
- ❌ Windows-style paths (`scripts\helper.py`)
- ❌ Nested references (SKILL.md → advanced.md → details.md)
- ❌ Time-sensitive info ("before August 2025...")
- ❌ Inconsistent terminology (mix "field", "box", "element")
- ❌ Too many options without clear default

---

## Core Workflow

### 1. Clarify Use Case
Ask user:
- **What's the core task?** (1 sentence)
- **When should it trigger?** (specific keywords/scenarios)
- **Supporting files needed?** (templates, scripts, references)
- **🔒 Public or Private Skill?**
  - **Public:** Synced to GitHub, listed in plugin.json & CLAUDE.md (shareable)
  - **Private:** In .gitignore, NOT in plugin.json/CLAUDE.md (personal data safe)

### 2. Design Skill Structure
**Minimal by default:**
```
.claude/skills/[skill-name]/
└── SKILL.md
```

**Add only if needed:**
- Reference docs (if complex domain knowledge)
- Templates (if user creates repeated structures)
- Scripts (if external tooling required)

### 3. Create SKILL.md
```yaml
---
name: [skill-name]
description: [What it does + When to use it. THIRD PERSON. Specific triggers!]
---

# [Skill Name]

## Instructions
[Step-by-step workflow - keep it to 3-7 steps max]

## Examples
[1-2 concrete examples showing input → output]
```

**Description Requirements:**
- ✅ **Third person** ("Processes PDFs", not "I can help process PDFs")
- ✅ **Specific triggers** (file types, keywords, scenarios)
- ✅ **What + When** (functionality + use cases)
- ✅ **Max 1024 chars** (concise!)

### 4. Configure Public/Private Mode

**If PRIVATE Skill:**
1. **Add to `.gitignore`:**
   ```
   # Private Skills (personal data, not synced to GitHub)
   .claude/skills/[skill-name]/
   ```
2. **DO NOT add to `plugin.json`** (skip step 5)
3. **DO NOT add to `CLAUDE.md`** (skip step 6)

**If PUBLIC Skill:**
1. **Skip .gitignore** (will be synced to GitHub)
2. **Proceed to steps 5 & 6** (add to plugin.json & CLAUDE.md)

### 5. Update plugin.json (PUBLIC Skills only)

Add to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` in `components.skills` array:
```json
{
  "name": "[skill-name]",
  "description": "[One-line description matching SKILL.md]"
}
```

### 6. Update CLAUDE.md (PUBLIC Skills only)

Add to `## 📋 Available Skills` section:
```markdown
- **`[skill-name]`** - [Brief description]
  - Location: `.claude/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`
  - Trigger: "[keywords]", "[scenarios]", "[file types]"
```

### 7. Test Trigger Description

**✅ Good Examples:**

*Example 1 - PRD Creation:*
"Create Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) in Confluence for Features/Epics. Use when user mentions 'PRD erstellen', 'Product Requirements', 'Confluence PRD', 'Feature Document', or 'Epic dokumentieren'."

*Example 2 - PDF Processing:*
"Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction."

*Example 3 - Git Commits:*
"Generate descriptive commit messages by analyzing git diffs. Use when the user asks for help writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes."

**❌ Bad Examples:**
- "Helps with documents." (too vague)
- "I can help you process Excel files." (first person, not third!)
- "Processes data." (what data? when?)

### 8. Validate & Iterate

**Functionality Test:**
- Test: Ask Claude a question matching the description
- Debug: If not triggering → check description specificity
- Refine: Remove unnecessary steps, keep it lean

**Public/Private Validation Checklist:**

**For PRIVATE Skills:**
- ✅ Skill folder added to `.gitignore`
- ✅ Skill NOT listed in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- ✅ Skill NOT listed in `CLAUDE.md`
- ✅ Skill NOT mentioned in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

**For PUBLIC Skills:**
- ✅ Skill NOT in `.gitignore` (will sync to GitHub)
- ✅ Skill added to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` components.skills array
- ✅ Skill added to `CLAUDE.md` Available Skills section
- ✅ Description matches across SKILL.md, plugin.json, and CLAUDE.md

**Quick Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Check if skill is private (should appear if private)
grep "[skill-name]" .gitignore

# Check if skill is public (should appear if public)
grep "[skill-name]" .claude-plugin/plugin.json
grep "[skill-name]" CLAUDE.md
```

## Best Practices

**✅ DO:**
- **One capability per Skill** (focused scope)
- **Third-person descriptions** with specific trigger keywords
- **Keep SKILL.md < 500 lines** (split into files if needed)
- **One-level-deep references** (SKILL.md → reference.md, NOT SKILL.md → advanced.md → details.md)
- **3-7 step workflows** (digestible, with checklists for complex tasks)
- **Concrete input → output examples** (show don't tell)
- **Consistent terminology** throughout (pick one term, stick with it)
- **Unix-style paths** (`reference/guide.md`, not `reference\guide.md`)
- **Feedback loops** for quality-critical tasks (validate → fix → repeat)
- **Build evaluations first** (test before extensive documentation)
- **Iterate with Claude** (use one instance to create, another to test)

**❌ DON'T:**
- Bundle multiple unrelated tasks in one Skill
- Use **first person** in descriptions ("I can help...")
- Use **second person** in descriptions ("You can use this to...")
- Vague descriptions ("helps with stuff")
- 20-step workflows with edge cases everywhere
- **Nested references** (keep one level deep from SKILL.md!)
- **Windows-style paths** (`scripts\helper.py`)
- **Time-sensitive information** ("before August 2025...")
- **Inconsistent terminology** (don't mix "field", "box", "element")
- Offer **too many options** without clear default
- Over-engineer before validation
- Create supporting files "just in case"

**🔒 Public/Private Decision Guide:**
- ✅ **Make PRIVATE if:**
  - Contains personal company data (COMPANY_CONTEXT.md, client names)
  - Uses sensitive API keys or credentials
  - Includes proprietary workflows or methodologies
  - References internal tools/systems not shareable
- ✅ **Make PUBLIC if:**
  - Generic workflow applicable to anyone
  - No personal/sensitive data dependencies
  - Adds value to Product-Toolkit for others
  - Safe to share on GitHub publicly

## Template: New Skill

When creating a new Skill, start with this:

```yaml
---
name: [kebab-case-name]
description: [THIRD PERSON. What it does + when to use it. Specific triggers. Max 1024 chars.]
---

# [Title Case Name]

## Instructions

1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Third step]

## Examples

**Example 1:**
Input: [User request]
Output: [What Skill produces]
```

**Description Template:**
```
[What the Skill does]. Use when user mentions '[keyword 1]', '[keyword 2]',
'[file type]', '[scenario]', or [specific context].
```

**Example:**
```
Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents.
Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms,
or document extraction.
```

---

## Example: Public vs. Private Skill

### Example 1: PUBLIC Skill (okr-expert)
**Why Public?**
- Generic OKR methodology (Wodtke + Klau)
- No personal company data
- Adds value to anyone using Product-Toolkit
- Safe to share on GitHub

**Implementation:**
- ✅ SKILL.md created in `.claude/skills/okr-expert/`
- ✅ Listed in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- ✅ Listed in `CLAUDE.md`
- ❌ NOT in `.gitignore`

### Example 2: PRIVATE Skill (client-specific automation)
**Why Private?**
- References specific client company names
- Uses internal tool URLs/credentials
- Contains proprietary methodologies
- Should NOT be on public GitHub

**Implementation:**
- ✅ SKILL.md created in `.claude/skills/client-automation/`
- ✅ Added to `.gitignore`: `.claude/skills/client-automation/`
- ❌ NOT in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- ❌ NOT in `CLAUDE.md`

**Example Private Skills:**
- `client-automation/` - Contains client-specific workflows
- `my-company-data/` - Contains proprietary company data
