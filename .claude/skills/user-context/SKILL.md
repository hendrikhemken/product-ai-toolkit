# User Context Setup

Guides Product Managers through collecting comprehensive context about their company, product, and team. This context enables all other Product-Toolkit skills (OKRs, PRDs, User Stories, etc.) to provide tailored recommendations.

## When to Use

**Init Mode (New User):**
- User is new to Product-Toolkit
- Mentions: "getting started", "setup", "onboarding", "initialize"
- No existing COMPANY_CONTEXT.md or context is incomplete

**Update Mode (Context Refresh):**
- User has changed companies, roles, or teams
- Mentions: "update context", "refresh context", "new job", "team changed"
- Generic update requests: "meine Infos updaten", "Infos aktualisieren", "Daten √§ndern"
- Existing context needs updating

## Instructions

### 1. Detect Mode

Check if `/user_context/COMPANY_CONTEXT.md` exists and has content:
- **If empty or missing:** Init Mode (collect all context)
- **If exists:** Update Mode (ask what changed, update specific sections)

### 2. Progressive Question Flow

Ask questions ONE AT A TIME in conversational style. Guide the user through the process. Don't overwhelm with too many questions at once.

**Core Questions (Must-Have):**

1. **Company Name & Industry**
   - "What's your company name and industry?"
   - Example: "Beyond 7, AI Consulting & Training"

2. **Company Type**
   - "What type of company? Startup (5-50), Scale-up (50-200), or Corporate (200+)?"
   - This determines OKR approach (Wodtke vs. Klau)

3. **Team Size**
   - "How many people total in the company?"
   - Example: "1 (Solo)" or "150"

4. **Your Role**
   - "What's your role? PM, Senior PM, Head of Product, CPO, Founder?"
   - Important for understanding scope of responsibilities

5. **Product Name & Type**
   - "What's your product name and type (SaaS, Platform, Mobile App, etc.)?"
   - Example: "Acme CRM, B2B SaaS Platform"

6. **Customer Type**
   - "Who are your customers? B2C, B2B, or B2B2C?"
   - Affects metric recommendations

7. **Website URL**
   - "What's your company website?"
   - Enables future research agents

8. **Tech Stack** (Optional)
   - "What's your tech stack? (Optional - skip if you don't know)"
   - Example: "React, Node.js, PostgreSQL"

9. **Dev Team Size & Structure**
   - "How big is your dev team and how is it structured?"
   - Example: "3 developers - 1 frontend, 1 backend, 1 fullstack"
   - If solo: "N/A (no dev team)"

9.5. **Team Members & Jira Roles** (Optional - only if Jira is available)
   - "Soll ich deine Jira Team Members abrufen und ihre Rollen erfassen?"
   - If yes:
     - Use `jira_search` to find recent tickets (last 30 days)
     - Extract unique comment authors from tickets
     - For each team member: Ask "Was macht [Name]?" (role/function)
     - Example roles: "Frontend Dev", "Product Designer", "Engineering Lead"
     - Write to COMPANY_CONTEXT.md "Team Members & Jira Roles" section
   - If no Jira access or user skips: Continue without blocking
   - Solo users: Offer to add just themselves

10. **Portfolio Structure** (Optional - ask ONLY if Head of Product or managing multiple products)
    - "Do you manage a single product or a portfolio?"
    - If portfolio: "List your products and mention if they roll up into one main product"
    - Keep it freetext, don't overcomplicate

11. **North Star Metric** (Optional)
    - "Do you have a defined North Star Metric? (Optional)"
    - Example: "Active Monthly Users" or "MRR Growth"
    - If not defined: Skip

12. **Current Quarter Focus**
    - "What are your top 2-3 priorities this quarter?"
    - Example: "Launch feature X, improve retention by 20%, hire 2 engineers"

### 3. Validate & Summarize

After collecting all info:
- Show a summary of what was collected
- Ask: "Does this look correct? Anything to adjust?"
- Give user chance to correct before writing to file

### 4. Write to File

Update `/user_context/COMPANY_CONTEXT.md`:
- **Init Mode:** Fill in all sections based on template
- **Update Mode:** Update only changed sections, preserve rest
- **Team Members:** If collected in Step 9.5, update "Team Members & Jira Roles" section in COMPANY_CONTEXT.md

**Important:**
- Update `last_updated` field to current date
- Keep existing content that wasn't changed (Update Mode)
- Follow template structure from `/user_context/COMPANY_CONTEXT.md`
- Team members go in Body (NOT YAML front matter!) under "## Team Structure" section

**Team Members Format:**
```markdown
### Team Members & Jira Roles
*For Jira Comment Digest context mapping*

**[Name]**
- Email: [email]
- Role: [role/function]
- Jira Active: Yes/No
- Notes: [optional context]
```

### 5. Confirm & Next Steps

After writing:
- "‚úÖ Context saved! You're all set up."
- If Team Mapping done: "‚úÖ Team Member mapping set up! Comment Digest will now show roles."
- Suggest logical next step based on role:
  - "Want to create your first OKRs?" (if no OKRs exist)
  - "Ready to create a PRD?" (if context complete)
  - "Need help with anything else?"

## Examples

**Example 1: New User (Init Mode)**

```
User: "I'm new here, how do I get started?"

Claude: "Welcome to Product-Toolkit! üéØ

I'll help you set up your context so I can give you tailored recommendations. This takes about 5 minutes.

Let's start simple:

**What's your company name and industry?**

Example: 'Acme Corp, FinTech'"

User: "TechFlow, SaaS for project management"

Claude: "Got it! TechFlow in Project Management SaaS. üëç

**What type of company are you?**
- Startup (5-50 people)
- Scale-up (50-200 people)
- Corporate (200+ people)"

[... continues progressively through all questions ...]

Claude: "Perfect! Here's what I've got:

üìã Summary:
- Company: TechFlow (Project Management SaaS)
- Type: Startup (25 people)
- Your Role: Head of Product
- Product: FlowApp (B2B SaaS)
- Customers: B2B
- Website: https://techflow.com
- Dev Team: 5 developers (2 frontend, 2 backend, 1 QA)
- North Star: Active Teams using FlowApp weekly
- Q4 Focus: Launch mobile app, improve onboarding, grow to 100 teams

Does this look correct?"

User: "Yes!"

Claude: "‚úÖ Context saved to /user_context/COMPANY_CONTEXT.md!

You're all set up. üéâ

**Next step:** Want me to help you create your Q4 OKRs? Since you're a Startup, I'd recommend Wodtke's weekly rhythm approach."
```

**Example 2: Update Mode**

```
User: "I need to update my context - I changed companies"

Claude: "Sure! Let me help you update your context.

What changed? New company, new role, or both?"

User: "Both - I'm now CPO at a bigger company"

Claude: "Nice move! üéâ Let me update that.

**New company name and industry?**"

[... asks only relevant questions ...]

Claude: "‚úÖ Updated! Your context now reflects:
- Company: BigCorp (Enterprise Software)
- Your Role: CPO (was: Head of Product)
- Company Type: Corporate 200+ (was: Startup)

Since you're now at a larger company, you might want to switch from weekly to quarterly OKR rhythm (Klau approach). Want help with that?"
```

## Edge Cases

**User doesn't know something:**
- "No problem! You can skip this or come back later."
- Mark as "TBD" in the file if important
- Don't block progress on optional fields

**Solo Consultant / Freelancer:**
- Many fields will be "N/A" or "1 (Solo)" - that's fine!
- Adjust questions accordingly (skip dev team structure if solo)

**Multi-Product Portfolio (Head of Product):**
- Ask about portfolio structure
- Keep it simple - freetext description of products
- Don't overcomplicate with nested structures

## Notes

**KISS Principle:**
- Start simple, don't overwhelm
- Progressive disclosure (one question at a time)
- Skip optional fields if user doesn't know
- Can always update later

**Conversational Tone:**
- Friendly, helpful, German & duzen
- Examples for every question
- Explain WHY we need certain info (e.g., "Company type determines OKR approach")

**Context is King:**
- This context powers ALL other skills
- Worth taking time to get it right
- But don't make it a burden - keep it light!
