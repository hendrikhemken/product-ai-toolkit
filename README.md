*Created by the **Product Brothers** - [Hendrik Hemken](https://linkedin.com/in/hendrikhemken) & [Sören von Sebelin](https://linkedin.com/in/soeren-von-sebelin)*

A lean, Claude Code-based toolkit that helps Product Managers with their daily work:
- Create OKRs (with best practices from Wodtke + Klau)
- Write User Stories & break down EPICs
- Create PRDs in Confluence
- Weekly OKR check-ins (Monday commitments, Friday celebrations)

**Target Audience:** Solo PMs & PM Teams in Startups, Scale-ups & Corporates

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**1. Prerequisites**

- [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
- MCP Servers configured (Confluence, Jira - optional but recommended)

**2. Setup**

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/hendrikhemken/product-ai-toolkit.git
cd product-ai-toolkit

# Open in Claude Code
claude code .

# On first session, Claude will auto-detect and guide you
# through context setup (5 min interactive questionnaire)
```

**Alternative (Manual Setup):**
```bash
# Copy the company context template
cp user_context/COMPANY_CONTEXT.template.md user_context/COMPANY_CONTEXT.md

# Edit COMPANY_CONTEXT.md with your company details
# Then open in Claude Code

```

**3. Start Using**

The toolkit activates automatically when you mention relevant keywords:

- **OKRs:** "Let's create my Q4 OKRs" → `okr-expert` skill activates
- **User Stories:** "Break down this EPIC" → `user-stories` skill activates
- **PRDs:** "Create a PRD for Feature X" → `prd-creator` skill activates

## 📖 How It Works

**The Product-Toolkit is your Daily PM Assistant:**

1. **Context-Aware:** Adapts to your company type (Startup vs Corporate), customer type (B2C vs B2B), team size
2. **Skill-Based:** Skills activate automatically when you mention keywords (no manual invocation)
3. **Opinionated:** Enforces best practices (INVEST, Outcomes > Outputs, no cargo cult OKRs)
4. **Proactive:** Tracks progress, reminds you of deadlines, identifies blockers
5. **Integrated:** Works directly with Confluence, Jira, Figma via MCP servers

**Example Session:**

```
You: "Let's create my Q4 2025 OKRs"

Claude: "Cool! I see you're a Solo Consultant (from COMPANY_CONTEXT).
         I'll use Wodtke's Weekly Rhythm approach.

         What's your North Star for Q4?"

You: "Sign 3 retainer clients at €3K/month MRR"

Claude: "Nice! Let me draft an Objective + Key Results...

         [drafts OKR]

         Red Team Check: This KR is gameable - could you sign
         low-quality clients. Should we add a quality gate (NPS 50+)?"

You: "Good catch! Yes, add that."

Claude: "✅ Updated. Confidence level 5/10?
         I'll create the file at /outputs/okrs/Q4-2025-OKRs.md
         and set up your weekly Monday/Friday check-ins."
```
