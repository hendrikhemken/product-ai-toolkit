## üìñ How It Works

**The Product-Toolkit is your Daily PM Assistant:**

1. **Context-Aware:** Adapts to your company type (Startup vs Corporate), customer type (B2C vs B2B), team size
2. **Skill-Based:** Skills activate automatically when you mention keywords (no manual invocation)
3. **Opinionated:** Enforces best practices (INVEST, Outcomes > Outputs, no cargo cult OKRs)
4. **Proactive:** Tracks progress, reminds you of deadlines, identifies blockers
5. **Integrated:** Works directly with Confluence, Jira, Figma via MCP servers

**Example Session:**

```
You: "Let's create my Q4 2025 OKRs"

Claude: "Cool! I see you're a Solo Consultant (from COMPANY_CONTEXT).
         I'll use Wodtke's Weekly Rhythm approach.

         What's your North Star for Q4?"

You: "Sign 3 retainer clients at ‚Ç¨3K/month MRR"

Claude: "Nice! Let me draft an Objective + Key Results...

         [drafts OKR]

         Red Team Check: This KR is gameable - could you sign
         low-quality clients. Should we add a quality gate (NPS 50+)?"

You: "Good catch! Yes, add that."

Claude: "‚úÖ Updated. Confidence level 5/10?
         I'll create the file at /outputs/okrs/Q4-2025-OKRs.md
         and set up your weekly Monday/Friday check-ins."
```
