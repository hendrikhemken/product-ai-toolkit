## ðŸ“‚ What's Here

### OKRs
**`okrs/Q4-2025-SaaS-Startup-Example.md`**

A complete OKR set for a fictional B2B SaaS startup proving Product-Market Fit.

**What it demonstrates:**
- âœ… Wodtke's Weekly Rhythm (Monday Commitments, Friday Celebrations)
- âœ… Outcomes > Outputs (MRR growth, not "ship features")
- âœ… Quality Gates (prevents gaming metrics)
- âœ… 5/10 Confidence level (ambitious but realistic)
- âœ… Measurable KRs (clear numbers, no vague goals)
- âœ… Red Team checks (catches perverse incentives)

**Use this to:**
- See what good OKRs look like
- Understand Wodtke's approach in practice
- Learn how to avoid common mistakes

---

## ðŸš€ How to Use These Examples

**1. Read & Learn**
- Review the example OKRs
- Understand WHY they're structured this way
- Note the quality gates and Red Team checks

**2. Adapt, Don't Copy**
- Use as inspiration for YOUR OKRs
- Your context is different (company, stage, market)
- The toolkit will help you create context-specific OKRs

**3. Start Fresh in `/outputs/`**
- Don't edit these examples
- Your OKRs live in `/outputs/okrs/`
- The toolkit creates files there automatically

## ðŸŽ¯ Creating Your Own OKRs

**Ready to create your own?**

1. Fill out `/user_context/COMPANY_CONTEXT.md` (copy from template)
2. Say: "Let's create my Q4 2025 OKRs"
3. The `okr-expert` skill activates automatically
4. OKRs are saved to `/outputs/okrs/YOUR-OKRs.md`

**The toolkit will:**
- âœ… Adapt to your company type (Startup vs Corporate)
- âœ… Recommend the right approach (Wodtke vs Klau)
- âœ… Enforce quality (Outcomes > Outputs)
- âœ… Run Red Team checks (catch gaming)
