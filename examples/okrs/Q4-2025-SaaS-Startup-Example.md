# Q4 2025 OKRs - SaaS Startup Example
*Proving Product-Market Fit & Revenue Model*

**Company Context:**
- B2B SaaS (Product Analytics Tool)
- Series A funded, 25 employees
- $200K MRR, 50 paying customers
- Target: PMF validated, ready to scale in 2026

---

## üéØ OBJECTIVE

**"Prove Product-Market Fit for Mid-Market Teams"**

**Why this focus:**
- North Star = MRR from Mid-Market customers (50-200 employees)
- Q4 = Validation Quarter (proof we can win mid-market before scaling sales)
- Pivoting from SMB ‚Üí Mid-Market (bigger ACV, better retention)

**Success means:**
- Mid-market customers paying & staying (not churning)
- Feature adoption validates our positioning (teams actually use advanced features)
- Sales cycle proven repeatable (not just founder-led deals)
- NPS validates we're solving real pain (not just "nice to have")

---

## üìä KEY RESULTS

### KR1: Revenue & Customer Growth
**Target:** $300K MRR from 15 mid-market customers (avg $20K ACV)

- **Start (Oct 1):** $200K MRR, 50 customers (mostly SMB)
- **Target (Dec 31):** $300K MRR, 15 mid-market customers signed
- **Confidence:** 5/10 (needs pipeline + conversion + delivery)
- **Why:** Proves mid-market model works (bigger ACV, better unit economics)

**Current:** $200K MRR, 0 mid-market | Target: $300K MRR, 15 mid-market

**Quality Gate:** Mid-market = 50-200 employees, $15K+ ACV minimum

---

### KR2: Product Adoption (Value Realization)
**Target:** 80% of mid-market customers adopt Advanced Analytics (our differentiated feature)

- **Start (Oct 1):** Advanced Analytics launched, low adoption in SMB segment
- **Target (Dec 31):** 12 of 15 mid-market customers (80%) actively use Advanced Analytics
- **Confidence:** 4/10 (needs product-led onboarding + customer success)
- **Why:** Proves we deliver differentiated value (not just basic analytics)

**Current:** 0% adoption (no mid-market customers yet) | Target: 80% adoption

**Quality Gate:** "Active use" = 10+ sessions/month, 3+ team members using feature

---

### KR3: Customer Satisfaction & Retention
**Target:** NPS 50+ from mid-market customers AND 0 churn

- **Start (Oct 1):** No mid-market customers yet
- **Target (Dec 31):** NPS 50+ survey result + zero churn from mid-market cohort
- **Confidence:** 6/10 (delivery strong, but NPS 50+ is ambitious)
- **Why:** Proves we retain mid-market (SMB churn was 10%/month - too high!)

**Current:** N/A | Target: NPS 50+, 0 churn

**Quality Gate:** Min 10 NPS responses, measured at 60-day mark

---

### KR4: Sales Efficiency (Repeatability)
**Target:** Close 15 mid-market deals with <45 day sales cycle (avg)

- **Start (Oct 1):** Sales cycle = 90+ days (founder-led, slow)
- **Target (Dec 31):** 15 mid-market deals closed, avg <45 days from demo ‚Üí contract
- **Confidence:** 4/10 (needs playbook + AE ramp + demand gen)
- **Why:** Proves we can sell repeatably without founder (scalable GTM)

**Current:** 0 mid-market deals, 90+ day cycles | Target: 15 deals, <45 days

**Quality Gate:** "Mid-market deal" = qualified (budget, authority, need, timeline)

## üîÑ Weekly Cadence (Wodtke Style)

### Monday Commitments (15 min)
**"What are we doing THIS WEEK for these OKRs?"**

- Update confidence level (0.0-1.0) for each KR
- Pick 1-3 concrete actions per KR
- Write down commitments

**Team Meeting:**
- Product, Sales, Customer Success leads
- 15 minutes max
- Focus: Commitments, not status updates

### Friday Celebrations (15 min)
**"What did we accomplish? What did we learn?"**

- Mark wins (even small ones!)
- Update progress on KRs
- Learning: What's working? What's not?
- Adjust next week's approach

**Without weekly cadence ‚Üí OKRs die!** (Wodtke's #1 Rule)

## üìà Mid-Quarter Check-In (Nov 15, 2025)

**Halfway Point - Are we on track?**

**Projected Scores:**
- KR1: Projected __.__ (need 0.6+ to hit target)
- KR2: Projected __.__
- KR3: Projected __.__
- KR4: Projected __.__

**Decision Point:**
- ‚úÖ On Track ‚Üí Keep going!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Behind ‚Üí What do we adjust? (scope, timeline, approach?)
- üî¥ Way Off ‚Üí Do we pivot the OKR? (dangerous! but sometimes necessary)

**Learnings So Far:**
- What's working?
- What's not?
- What surprised us?

---

## üìà End-of-Quarter Grading (Dec 31, 2025)

**Final Scores:**
- KR1 ($300K MRR, 15 customers): __.__
- KR2 (80% feature adoption): __.__
- KR3 (NPS 50+, 0 churn): __.__
- KR4 (15 deals, <45 days): __.__

**Overall Score:** __.__ / 1.0

**Wodtke Grading:**
- 0.6-0.7 = SUCCESS! üéâ (Hit ambitious targets!)
- 0.8-1.0 = Too conservative (sandbagged, aim higher next time)
- 0.4-0.6 = Learned a lot (missed targets but validated approach)
- 0.0-0.4 = Missed badly (pivot needed)

**Retrospective Questions:**
1. Did we prove Product-Market Fit for mid-market? (Yes/No/Partially)
2. What worked better than expected?
3. What failed? Why?
4. What did we learn about our customers?
5. What should we double down on in Q1 2026?
6. What should we stop doing?

## üö® Critical Reminders

### Wodtke's 5 Deadly Mistakes (AVOID!)
1. ‚ùå **Set & Forget** ‚Üí Weekly tracking is NON-NEGOTIABLE!
2. ‚ùå **Goal-of-Week Whiplash** ‚Üí Don't change OKRs mid-quarter!
3. ‚ùå **Too Many OKRs** ‚Üí We have 1 Objective, 4 KRs (max!)
4. ‚ùå **Micromanaging** ‚Üí Trust the team, focus on outcomes
5. ‚ùå **All at Once** ‚Üí This is our pilot, iterate in Q1!

### Red Team Check
**Ask yourself weekly:**
- ‚úÖ Can we game these KRs? (Added quality gates!)
- ‚úÖ Can we achieve this without business impact? (No - all tied to revenue/retention!)
- ‚úÖ Are we measuring activities or outcomes? (Outcomes only!)

**Examples of Gaming (we prevented):**
- ‚ùå KR1: "15 customers" ‚Üí Could be tiny/bad-fit customers (Fixed: $15K+ ACV min)
- ‚ùå KR2: "80% adopt" ‚Üí Could be 1 login = "adoption" (Fixed: 10+ sessions/month)
- ‚ùå KR4: "<45 days" ‚Üí Could rush bad deals (Fixed: Qualified leads only)

### OKRs ‚â† Performance Review
**Remember:**
- OKRs = Stretch goals (designed to sometimes fail)
- Performance = Job expectations (must hit)
- NEVER conflate them or you'll sandbag immediately!

## üéØ Alignment: How OKRs Cascade

**Company OKR (This File):**
Prove Product-Market Fit for Mid-Market Teams

**‚Üì Informs Team OKRs:**

**Product Team OKR:**
- Objective: "Make Advanced Analytics the reason mid-market buys"
- KR: Ship 3 mid-market specific features (ROI calc, team dashboards, SSO)
- KR: 80% feature adoption in mid-market cohort

**Sales Team OKR:**
- Objective: "Prove repeatable mid-market sales motion"
- KR: Close 15 mid-market deals, <45 day cycle
- KR: Build playbook (used by 3 AEs successfully)

**Customer Success OKR:**
- Objective: "Retain & expand every mid-market customer"
- KR: NPS 50+, 0 churn
- KR: 50% of customers expand to additional seats by end of quarter

**Note:** Each team's OKRs ladder up to company OKR!

> "The secret to OKRs is not the framework, it's the cadence. Without weekly check-ins, OKRs die." - Christina Wodtke

## üí° Why This Example?

**This OKR demonstrates:**
- ‚úÖ **Outcomes > Outputs** (MRR growth, not "launch 10 features")
- ‚úÖ **Quality Gates** (prevents gaming: $15K+ ACV, 10+ sessions/month)
- ‚úÖ **Ambitious but Realistic** (5/10 confidence, designed to stretch)
- ‚úÖ **Business Impact** (All KRs tie to revenue/retention)
- ‚úÖ **Measurable** (Clear numbers, no vague "improve X")
- ‚úÖ **Cascading Alignment** (Company ‚Üí Team OKRs)

**Common Mistakes AVOIDED:**
- ‚ùå "Launch 5 features" ‚Üí Activity, not outcome
- ‚ùå "Improve customer satisfaction" ‚Üí Not measurable
- ‚ùå "Hire 10 engineers" ‚Üí Input, not impact
- ‚ùå Too many OKRs (we have 1 Objective, 4 KRs max)
