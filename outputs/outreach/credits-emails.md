## üìß Template 1: Christina Wodtke (Radical Focus)

**Subject:** Open Source PM-Toolkit based on "Radical Focus" - your blessing?

---

Hey Christina,

I'm Hendrik, former CPO (12 years in FinTech) now building AI consulting tools for Product Managers in Europe.

I've created an open-source **"Product-Toolkit"** (Claude Code-based AI assistant) that teaches PMs how to apply OKRs, write User Stories, create PRDs, etc. - basically helping them do better product work.

**For the OKR methodology, I heavily reference your "Radical Focus" approach:**
- Weekly Monday/Friday rhythm (not just quarterly reviews)
- 5/10 confidence ratings (ambitious but realistic)
- Outcomes > Outputs philosophy (no activity-based KRs!)
- The mantra: "The secret to OKRs is not the framework, it's the cadence"

**The toolkit is:**
- ‚úÖ Free & Open Source (MIT License)
- ‚úÖ Educational (teaching your approach, not selling it)
- ‚úÖ Full attribution to you + links to "Radical Focus" on Amazon
- ‚úÖ Helps PMs actually APPLY what you teach (implementation > theory)

**My question:** Is this cool with you?

If yes, I'd love to feature it prominently in the README:
*"OKR methodology based on Christina Wodtke's Radical Focus - Weekly cadence, 5/10 confidence, Monday/Friday rhythm"*

If you have any concerns or want me to adjust the attribution, I'm happy to do so.

Your work has fundamentally changed how I approach product strategy - the weekly rhythm especially has been a game-changer. Thank you for that!

**GitHub Repo:** [will add link after publishing]

Best,
Hendrik

Hi Christina,

Quick question: I've built an open-source "Product-Toolkit" (Claude Code AI assistant) that teaches PMs how to do OKRs properly.

I heavily reference your "Radical Focus" methodology - weekly Monday/Friday rhythm, 5/10 confidence, outcomes > outputs. Full attribution + Amazon book links.

**Is this OK with you?** Toolkit is free, educational, helps PMs APPLY your approach (not replace your book).

If yes ‚Üí I'll feature it proudly: "Based on Christina Wodtke's Radical Focus"
If concerns ‚Üí Happy to adjust

Your work changed how I do product. Thanks for that!

## üìß Template 2: Marty Cagan (INSPIRED)

**Subject:** Open Source PM-Toolkit featuring your "Product Teams" critique - permission?

---

Hey Marty,

I'm Hendrik, former CPO (12 years FinTech) now helping teams implement AI tools for better product work.

I've built an open-source **"Product-Toolkit"** (Claude Code-based) that teaches PMs best practices for OKRs, User Stories, PRDs, etc.

**For OKRs specifically, I reference your critical perspective from "INSPIRED":**
- Feature Teams vs Product Teams distinction (OKRs fail in Feature Teams!)
- OKR Prerequisites (strategy, empowerment, leadership commitment)
- The warning: "You can't overlay OKRs from a radically different culture and expect that will work"
- Your critique of "Cargo Cult OKRs"

**Why I include this:**
I use your work to PREVENT teams from blindly implementing OKRs when they don't have the prerequisites in place. It's a "critical test" before recommending OKRs at all.

**The toolkit is:**
- ‚úÖ Free & Open Source (MIT License)
- ‚úÖ Educational (preventing cargo cult adoption)
- ‚úÖ Full attribution + links to "INSPIRED" and svpg.com
- ‚úÖ Helps teams assess if they're ready for OKRs (using your framework)

**My question:** Is this cool with you?

If yes, I'd feature:
*"OKR prerequisites framework based on Marty Cagan's INSPIRED - ensuring teams are ready before implementing OKRs"*

Your work on Product Teams vs Feature Teams has saved countless orgs from wasting time on frameworks they're not ready for. Thank you for that clarity!

Best,
Hendrik

Hi Marty,

Quick ask: I've built an open-source "Product-Toolkit" (AI assistant for PMs) that teaches OKRs, User Stories, PRDs.

I reference your "INSPIRED" work heavily - especially the **Feature Teams vs Product Teams critique** and **OKR Prerequisites** check.

**Why?** To PREVENT cargo cult OKRs. Teams have to pass your "critical test" before I even recommend OKRs.

**Is this OK?** Toolkit is free, educational, full attribution to you + SVPG book links.

If yes ‚Üí Featured: "OKR prerequisites based on Marty Cagan's INSPIRED"
If concerns ‚Üí Happy to adjust

Your Product Teams framework saved me from countless bad implementations. Thanks!

## üìß Template 3: Rick Klau (Optional - Google OKRs)

**Subject:** Open Source PM-Toolkit featuring Google's OKR approach - OK?

---

Hey Rick,

I'm Hendrik, former CPO now building AI tools for Product Managers in Europe.

I've created an open-source **"Product-Toolkit"** (Claude Code-based) that teaches PMs how to implement OKRs, User Stories, PRDs, etc.

**For Corporate OKR approach, I reference your legendary Google Ventures talk:**
- Quarterly grading (0.0-1.0 scale)
- Target: 0.6-0.7 = SUCCESS (not 1.0!)
- Full transparency (all OKRs public internally)
- Separate from performance reviews (critical!)

**The toolkit is:**
- ‚úÖ Free & Open Source (MIT License)
- ‚úÖ Educational (teaching Google's approach vs Startup approach)
- ‚úÖ Full attribution + YouTube link to your GV talk
- ‚úÖ Helps teams choose the right cadence (Weekly vs Quarterly)

**My question:** Is this cool with you?

If yes:
*"Corporate OKR approach based on Rick Klau's Google OKR methodology - Quarterly grading, transparency, 0.6-0.7 = success"*

Your talk is the gold standard for understanding how Google scaled OKRs. It's required viewing for anyone implementing OKRs at scale.

Best,
Hendrik
