-->

## üí° Notes for Claude

<!-- This section helps Claude understand how to use YOUR context -->

### Important Context for OKR Creation

**YOUR_COMPANY_REALITY:**

<!-- What's unique about YOUR situation that affects OKRs? -->
<!-- Examples:
- Solo? ‚Üí Weekly rhythm, small scope
- Startup? ‚Üí Fast iteration, ambitious targets
- Corporate? ‚Üí Quarterly planning, transparency, alignment
- Regulated? ‚Üí Compliance gates, slower iteration
-->

YOUR_OKRCONSIDERATIONS

**Recommended OKR Approach:**

<!-- Based on company_type, Claude will auto-recommend, but you can override: -->

- **Cadence:** YOUR_PREFERRED_CADENCE # e.g., Weekly (Wodtke), Quarterly (Klau), Monthly
- **Confidence Level:** YOUR_CONFIDENCE_LEVEL # e.g., 5/10 (Startup), 7/10 (Corporate)
- **Grading:** YOUR_GRADING_STYLE # e.g., Confidence ratings, 0.0-1.0 scale, Binary (done/not done)

**Key Tensions to Balance in OKRs:**

<!-- What trade-offs does your company face? -->

- YOUR_TENSION_1 # e.g., Speed vs Quality
- YOUR_TENSION_2 # e.g., Growth vs Profitability
- YOUR_TENSION_3 # e.g., New Features vs Tech Debt

### Typical Use Cases for this Context

<!-- What will you use the Product-Toolkit for? -->

- **OKR Creation:** YOUR_OKR_USE_CASE
- **User Stories:** YOUR_USER_STORY_USE_CASE
- **PRD Creation:** YOUR_PRD_USE_CASE
